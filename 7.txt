Recorded unknown date

Estate Papers comprise 43 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Albright, Jacob (1812)".  First inventory was in February 1792 after the testator died.  Another account and inventory was taken in 1812, and in the accounting was listed a coffin.  This may be Catherine's death.
