 <h1>Land Use Change in Chatham County, North Carolina</h1>
Below are links to five pages addressing the requirements of Homework 8.
<br>
<br>
I chose to look particularly at the vicinity of Andrews Store Road in Chatham County, NC - where the Briar Chapel neighborhood is now.   
This large new development had been a controversial proposal and the subject of local elections in Chatham County in 2004. The developer 
of Briar Chapel backed a slate of insurgent candidates for the Chatham County Board of Commissioners in November 2004. The newly elected 
board approved the controversial development in 2006. 
<br>
<br>
As you will see from the following pages, the snapshots of the area in 2008, 2014 and 2020 show dramatic changes in the landscape as land 
was cleared for the development in 2008, the project continued to unfold in 2014, and was completed in 2020. Additional development was also
approved for nearby areas to the north and east of the site.
