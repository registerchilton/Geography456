Additional Comments:

This will is incomplete.  The subsequent page or pages of this will are not here and reading the ink that bled through the page to the cover page, this appears to be all the pages that were written.  There is no signature. Not found in any indeces of any will books in the county - probably not ever recorded.

Name in will could be Abram? [rather than "Isham"]

The second page, if any, missing.

Estate papers comprise 30 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Allen, Abraham (1818)".  On 1 Mar 1823, distribution was made via John Scott, guardian to John Allen, Jane Allen, Elizabeth Allen, George Allen.  This distribution is sufficiently complex that these papers should be examined if there is interest in this lineage.  These papers include bond for the administrator, so it is assumed that the will was not accepted in court and rather than having an executor assigned by the will, the court appointed an administrator. Some transcribed below.
