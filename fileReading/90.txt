Recorded Feb 1842

The testator's name is clearly written with a middle initial of "S", except in the will book copy where it is clearly written "G." and also "S."

There is a second, handwritten copy of this will in the folder, made by George Laws, CCC, 21 Sep 1880.

Estate Papers comprise 26 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Cox, Thomas S (1880)".

When the land was divided in 1880, there are was clarification about the status of the heirs:
Mary died many years ago without issue.
Elizabeth married Samuel Wilkerson, who with her husband reside in Orange County, NC
Margaret married Alex Ellis who since died leaving Thomas C Ellis her only heir
Caroline married ________ Cheek and moved from the state, leaving one child Alexander P. Cheek who resides in Missouri.
Isabella remains single.

On 7 Apr 1881, Thomas H. Hughes was appointed receiver of the estate of Isabella C. Cox.  She seems to still be living at the time, but not able to manage her own affairs?  Isabella died 11 Aug 1887
