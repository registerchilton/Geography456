Thomas Burke was a medical doctor who served as Governor of North Carolina.  He was born in 1747 in County Galway, Ireland, and died at his estate called Tyaquin on 2 Dec 1783.

This transcription was taken from the will book, with clarifications taken from the original loose will.  Example: name of "Chritty" was indistinct in the will book copy because the t's were not crossed, making it appear to say "Chrilly".  Original is clearly "Chritty".

Estate Papers comprise 199 pages and are found in folder "Burke, Thomas (1786)".  James Hogg qualified as Executor. This estate is extensive - One inventory was taken in 1785 after the will was proved and a second inventory was taken in 1791.  The 1791 version is 21 pages - many pages of detailed explanations, notes, bonds, loans, in-process business dealings, etc.  Testator described as "Doctor Burke"  He had 1,819 acres at four locations, one in Randolph County, half of an additional tract of 640 acres in Caswell County, jointly owned with Robert Dickens.

Testator's widow Polley Burke married Major George Doherty, on 25 April 1785, per one of the copies of a report provided to Augt. Court 1793.  This seems to result in the lands being sold, per the will.

Estate papers contain numerous passing references to the slave Jack being hired and working for various people that are not transcribed here.

William Comb is mentioned frequently.  An entry implied that perhaps he was overseer of one of the plantations.

Will Book Volume B, pages 61-62 mentions a Writ of Fieri Facias pertaining to this estate, mentions slaves Jack and Maria sold to Francis Child.

The above fifteen negroes are all mentioned in Dr. Burke;s Will, but
Sam and Tom had belong'd to Mr McKnight's Estate, and came into
Dr. Burke's possession in the following manner - Mr. Alexr. Diach of Lor-
-fold in Virginia , Executor of Will. Aitcheson late of that Place, one em=
=ployed Dr. Burke to recover from Mr. McKnight's Estate a debt due to
Mr. Aitcheson. Judgmt. was obtained and the above mentioned Negroes
Sam and Tom, with others were levied on to satisfied [ink blot]

Mr. Diack for them; but if the payment was not made good, the property
was to remain unaltered -- This Purchase was made the 1st August
1783 a few months before Dr. Burke's death; see Dr. Burke's letter to Mr
Diack dated 2d August 1783, returned to me by Mr. Diack, and now in
my possession and files -- Mr. Burke was at Edenton in November 1783
and gave to Mr. Diack a Tobacco note of ___ John Prior for 50
Dollars and gave his own note for sixty nine pounds V. money in part payment
Mr. Burke died in Dec 1783; soon after his death Mr. Diack demanded
payment or a delivery of the Negroes; Circumstances as things were,
and considering the high Price Dr. Burke had promised for the Negroes,
Thought it best to give up the Negroes, and take back Mr. Burke's notes -

James was given to Dr. Burke as a fee by William Clements the Horse their
Dr. Burke being obliged to give half his value to Mr. James Williams for his fee, Henry
Spears brought Suit for the said Negro James; and before the Superior Court, April Term
1786 proved that James was stolen from him by the said Clement, and obtained Judg=
=ment accordingly ~~~~~~~~~
