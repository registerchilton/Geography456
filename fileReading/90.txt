Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume C, page 112
Recorded Feb 1798

Note 1: Pailling or paleing -> Paling is an archaic term for a picket fence.

Note 2: perhaps first or previous wife who predeceased testator?

Estate Papers comprise 29 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Holt, George (1807)".
William O'Neil is listed as deceased husband of legatee Elizabeth O'Neil. Testator's wife's name listed as Keziah Holt.

Thomas Lowe and Harmon are assumed to be the sons of Keziah Holt - perhaps from a previous marriage?
