Additional Comments:
The will does not appear to be found in the county will books, and estate papers assert he died intestate, so it appears that the will failed to be proved.

Estate Papers comprise 249 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Garrard, Tyre (1830)".  This testator was the administrator of Samuel Garrard, which resulted in hundreds of pages of paperwork from the court (see Will of Samuel Garrard), and in addition, the testator was engaged in a milling business in partnership with his brother-in-law, Richard Crabtree. The testator became ill and died in the midst of many transactions and was being sued by his partner, so again, a large number of estate papers, but containing little family history.

Testator died without issue.  Heirs-at-law: Nancy Garrard, James Garrard, Thomson Garrard, John Garrard, Britton Garrard, Stanford Garrard, Maria[aka Mariah] Betsey Gilliam and Nelson Wood children & heirs of Polly Wood, decd., and Betsy Garrard.

Testator's widow, Elizabeth Garrard later married Nathaniel Harry

Harrison Parker was appointed administrator of the estate.

Inventory of 2 Jan 1829 lists "1 Negroe Man Willis", not included in the estate sale, and retained by Elizabeth.

"Betsy Woods" married George Freeman, and lived in Carroll County, Tennessee by 1839

Note 1: Pendente Lite: This is a Latin term that means "pending the litigation." For example, pendente lite is used to describe court orders that are put into effect while litigation is still pending, in order to facilitate fair administration of justice.

 Note 2: Tyre Garrard's will is dated 8 Oct 1828, so he probably did not die in Sept 1828 as this petition asserts...

[Estate Papers - Bill of Complaint Filed 13 Mar 1830]

State of North Carolina }
          Orange County }   In Equity

                 To his honor the judge of the court of Equity
for yte County of Orange humbly complaining sheweth to your
honor your orator Richard Crabtree; that some time in the
year 1814 your orator and a certain Tyre Garrard late of this
county entered into a partnership for the purpose of erecting a
mill or mills upon Flat river in said County.  They agreed to
purchase a mill seat suitable for the purpose and to erect
a grist mill and a saw mill at joint expense and to
share equally the profits.  Your orator accordingly purchased
the land from a certain William Parish for the sum of
one hundred dollars all of which your orator paid himself
as it became due from the result of his own Labor but chiefly
from the profits of his blacksmiths shop in which your orator
laboured daily.  The said Garrard and your orator laboured
together and each furnished hands to erect the mill dam
and there is as your orator believes amongst the papers of
said Garrard a statement of the labor so done and
and account of the partnership between them.  During the
time of erecting the dam to wit or the 3rd of May 1816 your
orator & said Garrard in dividing the work on the dam
made a partial settlement only as to the board of the
labourers who worked on the dam and there will be found
amongst the papers of said Garrard an obligation entered
into by your orator to board hands to the amount of 326 days
whereon it shall be necessary or required of him by Samuel?

[page 2]
which requirement was afterwards made and your orator
furnished board to a much larger amount whilst the re
mainder of the work on the mill was going on; there are also
other papers in the possession of said Garrard or his administra
tor which clearly shew the partnership which existed be
tween your orator & himself in the said mill to which a receipt
executed 3d of Apl 1817 by Benjamin Nutt which was for money
paid said Nutt by your orator and said Garrard amounting to
sixty six dollars; and many of the evidences of the partnership
which he prays the court may be produced & delivered over
to the court by those herein after called defendants in whose
possession your orator charges they are.
You orator further charges that after the erecting of the mill
dam he went on the erect a mill house for the grist mill
and also for the saw mill to contract for and get finished[?]
the mill wrights work for each mill to make all the necessary
iron work to wit the nails and all other iron necessary for the
machinery of the two mills to make spikes for the works
in and about the mill and dam to furnish iron for the same
to furnish all the plank for the building [of] the mill houses
as well as for the dam; to furnish all the lumber that was
used, for any of these purposes and to pay out of his own prop
er funds for all the aforesaid work and labor when done
by others and to advance the labor done by himself.  There
was an agreement also between your orator and said Garrard
that all necessary houses for the accommodation of a family
should be put up or the land attached to the mill seat
at the joint expense of the parties, and your orator charges
that he did out of his own money and by his own labor [erasure]
pay for and erect all of said houses to wit a dwelling house
kitchen Corn house Smoke house Blacksmith shop stable

[page 3]

[corner missing "an"?]d all other houses which were erected on the said land were
at the expense of your orator alone.  All of which expenses and
charges will be made more ["apparent and" x-out] clear to the court
by an account herewith filed & prayed to be made a part
of this bill in which it will be seen that the said Garrard
is indebted to your orator in a large sum with interest on the
same since 1816,  The amount of money & labor advanced by
your orator after deducting one half as his portion is __
____________________________________________ as will more fully
appear by reference to said account, Your orator did not expect
when he at first entered into the said partnership to have had
to make such disadvantageous advancements and would
have refused to do so but your orator & said Garrard married
sisters and the said Garrard became shortly after very much
embarrassed & involved on account of this fathers estate on
which he administered and whenever applied to by your
orator to advance money replied that he could not at that
time.  This state of things continued until the year 1820
during all of which time the said Garrard regularly drew
from and enjoyed one half of the proceeds of each mill taking
his share of the tolls and plank which he continued to
do until he sold his portion to a certain Edward Davies
in the year 1820 as aforesaid.  Your orator frequently demanded a
settlement with said Garrard who did not comply but told your
orator that if he sued his (Garrard's) purse was longest & he would
wear him down at Law.  About this time Garrard sold his
interest in the Mills to a certain Edward Davies for Eight
hundred Dollars & received a conveyance and said Davies held
for some time the right of the property after which your
orator purchased the interest of Davies and gave him

[page 4]
Eight Hundred dollars for it.  And it was because of the
perplexing entrapment to which your orator was exposed
in raising this money that he was delayed in making ear-
lier application to this court for its aid in compelling Garrard
to settlement.  Not long after the purchase of Davies's
Interest by your Orator Garrard became much diseased &
almost incapacitated for business & afterwards died without issue since his death a
contest has taken place concerning the validity of his will
which has just terminated & a certain Harrison Parker has
been appointed his Administrator.

Now your orator is advised that the actings & doings of said Tyre
Garrard are contrary to Equity and good conscience and
charges that his personal estate has been committed to the said
Harrison Parker and the wife of Said Tyre Garrard towit Elizabeth
Garrard and his heirs at law Nancy Garrard James Garrard ["James" x-out]

relief to which he is entitled he prays your honor that the
said Harrison Parker Administrator of Tyre Garrard deced. and
Elizabeth Garrard widow of said Tyre shall on oath account

aforesaid that the other defendants heirs at law answer this

or to be advanced by either party, or as to the work done
or to be done nor as to the boarding of the hands - nor
how many ever to be or actually were found by the
parties respectively or how boarded & by whom as he
has not in his possession any papers relative to said
transaction nor has he ever had done[?] in particulars
he denies having or ever having had in his possession
or ever having seen the papers mentioned in Complain

[page 2]
-ants Bill ---
Complainant charges that he built the houses for the
grist & saw mill, furnished the millWrights work for each
Mill & that he made all the necessary iron work & ???
iron & plank & timer & paid out of his own proper
funds for all the aforesaid work & labour --- & that
there was an agreement to erect on the land attached
to the mill seat at their joint expense all necessary
houses for the accommodation of a family --- All this
may be true as far as this Defdt. knows -- but he believes
it to be utterly false & untrue --- he believes so because
his intestate was a hard working industrious man
possessed of a justly[?] little property & a good black
-smith by trade & had a shop I worked in it & the Con
-plainant was not entitled to any of these character
as far as he knows except being by trade a black-
-smith ---
    This Deft admitts the sale by his intestate in the year 1820
of his share in the mill to Edward Davis[sic] & who afterwords
["from Complt" x-out] sold out to Complainant for the sum of $800
as set forth in Complts Bill & this Deft in order to shew
to your Honor the utter falsehood of Complts now pretended
claim further states - that when Complt purchased from Edward
Davis his share in the mills he gave said Davis his sai[?]
-d bonds each for $400 & a deed of Trust upon the pro
-perty to secure the payt. thereof that payt. the Trustee Wi
-liam Horner by the direction of Davis advertised the
mills & premises for sale -- upon which Complt on the
on the[sic] 26th Nov 1821 ["filed"x-out] preferred his Bill in Equity be
-fore the Honorable William Norwood one of the Supr. Courts
of Law & Equity for an injunction to stop said sale -- &
which upon the representation of Complt. was granted & is
now of record in the Court of Equity for Orange County
& to which this Deft. prays lean[?] to refer your Honor for
greater certainty -- In his said Bill he alleges that

[page 3]
Tyre Garrard held the bond of said Davis & that it was
agreed expressly hence[?] him & said Davis "that any pay
-ments made by him to said Tyre Garrard should be ap
-plied to the credit of his bonds in the same manner as
if the payt. was made to the said Davis himself - he fur
-ther states that with a view to this arrangement he had
procured a bond given by said Tyre Garrard to one
Sterling Harris for $130 upon which only was due $100 --
which he lodged with Thos. Ruffin ["Davis's" x-out] Gararrds counsel as a cred
-it to the judt. against Davis & it was so ntd.? --- In his said
Bill he no where pretends that Garrard was indebted to
hin tho at that time the partnership had been dissolved
more than two years -- & it certainly would have been a very
convenient mode of paying his debt to Davis -- This Deft.
further shews that the partnership [????] Complt. & his in
-testate was dissolved on the 18th day of Nov 1819 by the sale
to Davis by Garrard & that Garrard died in the year
& that as far as this Deft. is informed no attempt was
ever made by Complt. to settle with Garrard in his life
time or any claim made -- & he prays the benefit of the
lapse of time as if the same was here specially pleaded
denying &c he prays hence to be dismd. &c with
his costs ---                                F. hart Sol.

            These Defendants by protestation not

form as the same all therein & thereby
charged & alleged, for Plea unto the said
Bill say that if the Complainant ever
had any cause of suit against Tyre
Garrard decd. for or concerning any of

Defendants do in no sort admit) the same
did arise or accrue more than three
years before filing said Bill & above three
years before service of process upon them
or either of them to appear & answer
the same - and these Defendants further
for plea say that they or either of them
or the said Tyre Garrard did not within
any tie within three years fefore[sic] filing
Complainant's said Bill of Complaint
nor within three year before these Defendants
are served with process to appear & answer

account for or to pay or any way satisfy said Compa=
inant any money for or concerning any [of]
the matters transactions or dealings in
Complainants  said Bill of Complaint
charged or alleged - & therefore these
Defendants do plead the act of the

[page 2]
General Assembly ["said Complainant"] or
Statute of Limitations made in the year 1715
& prays the benefit of the Statute oract
of the General Assembly for limitation of

    The replication of Richard Crabtree to the

    This repliant saving and reserving to himself all &
all manner of advantage of exception to the manifold
insufficiencies of the said Pleas and Answers, for a replica-
tion thereunto sayeth that he will aver and prove
his said bill to [be] true certain and sufficient in
the Law to be answered --- that the statute of Limitations
["ple" x-out] relied upon by the defendants can have no oppera-
tion in this case -- that it would otherwise bar his
claim against the defendants yet he avers that the said
Tyre Garrard deceased within three years before the
filing of this repliants bill distinctly acknowledged
his indebtedness to this repliant by reason of the matters
set forth in his said bill --- And further that the answers
and pleas for the said defendants are uncertain un-
true and insufficient to be replied unto by this repliant
without that &c All of which matters and things this
repliant is ready to aver and prove as this honourable
Court shall direct and humbly prays &c.
