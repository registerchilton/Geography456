Recorded Nov 1795

One of the longest "preambles" observed.  Testator appears to have a strong desire to declare faith known in his will, which resulted the beginning being almost as long as the body of the will containing the bequests, etc.

Surname rendered variously.  Body of will: Cleney, Signature:  Cleneay (Note: Not a "his mark"-type, written in a clear, strong hand, back of will: Clenney (probably written by a court clerk)

No estate papers found.
