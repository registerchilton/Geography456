[page marked "(1)"]
        In the name of God Amen.

I Jesse Benton of Orange County and state of North Carolina do
make this my last Will and Testament, in manner following (to wit)

        Whereas I heretofore purchased of Colo: David Hart of Caswell
County one moiety of his sixteenth part of two hundred thousand
acres of Land granted by the Assembly of Virginia to Richard
Henderson & Company, as tenants in Common, Situate on the Ohio
and Green rivers, which said Moiety containing by estimation, six
thousand two hundred and fifty [Acres], be the same more or less, I afterwards
sold to Captain Nathaniel Hart, late of Kentucky, deceased, and
have received the Consideration agreed on for the same, but have
not made any title in law to the said Nathaniel for the said
premises: I do therefore Will and devise all my Interest in the
said Lands to the devisees, heirs or assigns of the said Nathaniel
according to the disposition of the said lands made by the said
Nathaniel in his lifetime, if any such disposition, and if not then
to the heirs at law of the said Nathaniel according to the rules of
lenial[lineal] descent to the use of the said devisees, heirs or assigns of

[page marked "(2)"]
the said Nathaniel forever: And do request that the said David
Hart may execute a deed or deeds, for Conveying the said lands
accordingly, if necessary

                I Will and devise my plantation
called The Meadow Place which I purchased of John Fitzmiller
on McGowan's Creek in Orange County, to my beloved wife,
Nancy, to her and [her] heirs and assigns forever; which said plantation
contains by estimation two hundred and thirty acres, be the same
more or less; I also will to my said wife, three Negroes (to wit)
Jack, Milley and Rose, together with all my stock of Horses,
Cattle, Sheep, Hoggs and fowls (except so many of my horses as
my Executors may think necessary to sell and dispose of reserving
a Sufficient Number for my said wife) also all my household
and Kitchen furniture, Still, Waggon, gears and all my plantation
utensils; Meat, Corn, Wheat, and forage, on hand at the time of
my decease, and also one hundred pounds Current money, to her and
her heirs and assigns forever.

                I Will that when the first of my Chil:
:dren comes of age, or either of them marries, (which ever first happens)
that all the rest of my Negroes may be appraised by two respectable
freeholders, and put into as many lots as there may be of my children

[page marked "(3)"]
then living, so as to make said lots of Negroes as nearly equal in
value as may be, and the said lots to be drawn by my said children, or
some Judicious person in a fair and equitable manner, and that
each of my said Children shall have such lot so drawn for them
to them their heirs and assigns forever; but whereas some of the lots
so laid off may be of more value than others, it is my will that
those of my children drawing such lots, shall pay unto the others
a sum of money sufficient to make all the lots or shares of equal
value.

        But it is nevertheless ["it is" x-out] my Will and desire that my
said wife shall have the benefit of the work and labour of all
my negroes, in Consideration of her Cloathing and boarding my
said Children, and also for her clothing, feeding and paying
taxes for said Negroes, until the respective times of marriage
or coming of full age of my said children; And it is also my
will and desire that my children may all receive reasonable
education, at the expense of my Estate, and that my sons may at all
events ["may" x-out] be taught the English language as perfectly as may be
found necessary.

        And in order to Establish a fund for the payment
of my debts due Colo. Thomas Hart of Maryland, and William Cain
and Company of the town of Hillsborough and other creditors if any;

[page marked "(4)"]
It is my will and desire that my Executors Collect the debts due
to me by bonds notes or otherwise, as far as may be in their power
and sell and dispose of my Law Books; And It is also my
Will and desire that my Executors or a majority, or the survivor or
survivors of them do as soon as may be Convenient, and
necessary, sell and Convey, (and make and Execute a deed
or deeds in fee simple,) my Mills and plantation called
Hartford, or the Mills and part of the Land, or such other
of my Lands Situate in Orange County aforesaid, or all
or any part of my lands, on the Waters of the river Missi:
:ssippi; or any other Lands I may be possessed of or intitled
to at the time of my decease, at their discretion, suffi:
:cient for the purposes hereafter mentioned, that is to say,
for the payment of my debts; the legacy before mentioned
to my wife, my Funeral expenses, and reasonable allowances
to my Executors for their trouble and expenses in Executing
this my Will.

            And all the rest and residue of my lands
I give and devise to such of my Children, as may arrive
to the full age of twenty one years or marries, to be
vested in them at those periods as the one or the other

[page marked "(5)"]
may first happen, which said Lands so intended for
my Children, I will maybe put into as many lots as
there may be of my Children (when the first of them
arrives at full age or either of them marries which may
first happen) then living, so as to make each lot as
nearly equal in value or may be convenient, and that the
said lots may be drawn for by my said Children or by
two Judicious Freeholders, and that each and every of the
said lots of Land, be vested in my said Children respec:
:tively, as they shall marry or come of age, to them their
heirs and assigns forever.

            And it is further my Will
that in order to do Justice to my said Children and to
prevent disputes, I desire My Executors may appoint
some skilful person to reduce to writing and
describe particularly the Lands and Negroes which
may be drawn among my children and cause the
same to be attested by a Number of Witnesses and
Recorded.

            And I do also Will and desire that my Mills
and houses be repaired at the discretion of my
                                          Executors

[page marked "(6)"]
Executors, and at the expense of my Estate, and also
that my Executors advance such Sums of money for
securing the titles to my Western Lands as may
be necessary.

            And it is further my Will and desire
that my Wife Nancy enjoy all the profits and
benefit, arising from my Mills and Lands, until
my Executors shall make sale thereof or until
the division of my said Lands shall be made
amongst my Children as aforesaid. And I do
make my said wife Nancy my residuary Legatee
of all the rest and residue of my estate.

        And lastly I do appoint my said
Wife Nancy my Executrix, and Colo:
Alfred C Moore, William Watters and Absalom
Tatom my Executors, of this my last

Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume B, pages 144-148
Recorded Aug 1791

Despite the early date of the will (1790), the writing, wording, punctuation and spelling are relatively current.  The lines are widely spaced so although there are seven pages, it is not a long will.  This seems to describe an extensive estate.

Estate papers comprise 18 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Benton, Jesse (1791)". Inventory (May 1792) lists "fourteen negroes, towit, Chloe, Joe, Judah, Cupit, Doll, Alice, Thom, Isabell, Milley, Daniel, Jack, Rose, & her Child John..."
This seems to only be 13.  Another inventory lists "Elevin head of Negroes"
