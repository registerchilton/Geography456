Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume E, pages 338-339
Recorded May 1835

Note 1: Although the original says "in in", perhaps it should have said "one in"

Note 2: This signature resembles another unusual signature in the Will of Jacob Albright (1822) Looks like "Snuriecs Vynseral" and appears to be the pen name of Henry Garrott.
