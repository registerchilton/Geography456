Will of John Moore - 10 Mar 1809

I John Moore of the County of Orange within the
State of North Carolina being in the full exercise
of my mental Faculties do make and constitute my
last Will and Testament in manner following towit,

        In the first place I direct my Executors herein
after appointed; forthwith to pay all my just debts
out of any monies which be in hand at my decease,
and should it so happen that a sufficiency of money for this
purpose should not be left by me that then and
in that case I direct that out of the surplusage
part of the crop they cause to be made a sum
sufficient for the purpose ~~ This great duty can
easily, I hope, be performed, because at this time
I do not recollect that I owe a cent, except the sum
of eighty Dollars to the Estate of Daniel Boothe
deceased.

        as I have several Children yet in their non-
age and who require to be educated, and as I have
the most perfect confidence in the prudence and
affection of my wife and that she feels the obligation
of providing for them in as high a degree as I do
myself, because they are her children also, I therefore
lend to her during her widowhood, for she insists
to have the property no longer than she remains
unmarried, all my negroes not hereafter parti=
cularly bequeathed: the use of my plantation
whereon I now live with all the lands attached
thereto, except a part, the lower end, lying South
of a line hereafter directed to be run; all the
                                   farming/

[page 2]
farming utensils or tools: - the Waggon, team of Horses
and gear appertaining thereto: - eight Cows and Calves
such as she may make choise of: - all the crop
that may be raised in the year in which my death
may happen as well as a sufficient part of that
on hand to enable her to support herself, the
Children & stock until the new one is cribbed:
all the Beds and furniture, House hold and
Kitchen utensils with one half of the whole of
my stock of Hoggs subject however to the following
limitation & restrictions that is That my Children
yet requiring education are to be supported and
educated out of the proceeds of the Crops and
as they, towit, Mary, Nancy, Susanna, Lewis Betsey
and Sally respectively marry. I give to them a
Bed and furniture, together with a legacy in
a negroe, or negroes, out of those loaned to my
said Wife, equal in value to a negro wench
Lizza & her Child Calea[Celia] which I gave to my
Daughter Francis when she intermarried with
her husband John Hart to them their Heirs
and assigns for ever.  And lest the gift of the
aforesaid wench Lizzy & her child Calia[Celia] may
be questioned, I hereby give and bequeath
them to my said Daughter Francis Hart
her Heirs and assigns for ever.  And to enable
my Executors hereinafter mentioned to carry
into effect this part of my will with as little
room for suspicion as possible and as much justice as
["possible" x-out] practicable, I request & direct that they
                                              apply/

[page 3]
apply to the Court of the County of Orange, who I
hereby authorize to do so, to appoint one or more
discrete person or persons to act as Commissioners,
to aid them in making the allotments herein before
mentioned to the aforesaid mentioned Children ----
as they respectively marry: and the decision or
acting in this respect by the said Commissioner
or Commissioners & the Executors shall be binding
and conclusive; and the legacy shall immediately
thereupon vest in the said Child for whose benefit
it is made, and enure to him or her, his or her
Heirs and assigns for ever

        I give to my son Thomas Moore one half of a
tract of land which I own in the State of Tennessee
situated on Blooming Grove Creek in Montgomery
County to be ascertained in manner hereinafter mentioned
to him his Heirs and assigns for ever.

        I give and devise to my Son Sampson Moore
all the land lying south of a line to being on the
old road, in a hollow, a little north of a spot
generally called & known by the name of the Knoll
running thence East to the line of the lands of
Colonel Greene and west from the said point
of beginning to my back line; it being the
lower end of the tract of land on which I
now live; together with the other half or moiety of
my land on the Blooming Grove Creek in the
State of Tennessee to him and his Heirs for
ever. -- And that no ground may exist for disa=
greement between my said Sons Thomas and
                                Sampson /

[page 4]
Sampson in dividing the aforesaid tract of land
in the Blooming Grove Creek, My Will is that my
Son Thomas who is now living thereon shall
retain that part in which he is in possession;
and that in dividing it no regard or estimate
shall be had of the improvement made thereon
by him: but that a division shall be had of
the lands as if they were in a state of nature
regard being had though to quality and quantity

        I give and devise to my Son Lewis, to take effect
after the widowhood of my said Wife [x-out], the
upper and remaining part of the tract of land
I now live on, not given to my Son Sampson
to him his Heirs and assigns for ever.

        all the remaining part of my estate not
specifically given away nor loaned to my wife
I direct shall immediately after my decease be
sold by my Executors at a credit of twelve
months and the money arising thereupon be equally
divided among my Children share and share
alike.

        As I am well acquainted with the disposition
of the negroes loaned to my wife, and therefore an=
=ticipate that it will be with much difficulty, if at
all, she can mange or govern some of them
to guard against such an event I hereby authorise
my Executors to remove the turbulent and ungovern=
=able ones from among the rest by hireing them
out from year to year ~ the money arising from
such hireings to be paid over to my wife to aid
her in supporting and educating my Children
                                      after /

[page 5]
    after my aforesaid Children Mary, Nancy,
Susannah, Lewis, Betsey and Sarah have each
recovered their legacy agreeable to the provisions of the
second section of this my will from among the
negroes loaned to my wife as aforesaid and after
too ["the" x-out] her widowhood ceases.  My will and desire is
that the remainder of my estate, except the negroes
of whatever nature or kind it may be remaining
undisposed of, be sold by my Executors at a
credit of twelve months, and the money arising
therefrom to be equally divided among all my
Children then living and the representatives of
those dead, if any.

        And as I am extremely anxious and
desirous that none of the negroes should be sold
out of the family, I expressly require authorise and
direct my Executors to effect a division of them
among my Children, I mean those negroes loaned
to my Wife and remaining after my Children
aforesaid have been provided for as directed,
without making sale of any of them. But if unhap=
=pily it should not be in the power of my Executors
with the help of Commissioners to be appointed
by the Court as hereinbefore directed to divide
the said Negros among all my Children and
the representatives of those who may be dead
in an agreeable and equal manner then I direct
that they be sold by my Executors at a credit
of one year and the money divided among my
                                Children/

[page 5]
Children in the same manner as directed as to the
negroes, that is share and share like.

        I nominate and appoint my wife Nancey
Executrix, my son Sampson Moore, and friend
Man Patterson Executors of this my last will
and Testament ~~ Hereby revoking all other wills
heretofore made by me & acknowledging this to be
my only last Will & Testament  ~~~ In Testimony
