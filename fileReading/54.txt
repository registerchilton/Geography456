Recorded May 1798

What appears to be written "Thusiah Hendison" in the will.  It is written slightly differently in the will book copy as "Thaipiah Henderson", converting the ligature in the original to the letter "p" and spelling the surname in a more common manner...  Perhaps Thusiah Henderson.  Perhaps a variant of Arthusia?
