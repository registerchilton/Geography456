Recorded Aug 1820

First phrases, down to the word "to be buried" almost a word-for-word duplicate of the Isaac Jackson Jr. 1814 will.  Although they are all stock phrases, that close correlation is unusual.

The "Noth" that was crossed out may be the start of the stock phrase about the resurrection.

Loose will was written with very wide spacing between rows, and in a very clear hand. Not a very long will, but takes up 2 1/2 long sheets of paper (7 3/4 X 12 1/2 - not quite foolscap size).  This will could have easily fit unto one page without reducing the size of the writing.

Testator's mark is not the common "X" or "+", but rather a scrawled circle.

No estate papers found specifically for this testator, but Estate Papers comprising 108 pages were found in a folder labeled "Jackson, Isaac (1820)", some of which pertain to this estate.  If one is interested in this particular estate, look for papers with Levi Jackson as Executor.  Note that Benoni Jackson was the executor for both Isaac Jackson, Jr (will dated 1814) and for estate of Isaac Jackson, Sr (will dated 1824).

Samuel Cloud married Sarah Jackson, sister of the testator.
