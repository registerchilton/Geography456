Additional Comments:
Not found in will books.

Estate Papers comprise 74 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Murdock, Margaret (1837)".  The will was disputed.  Court of Pleas and Quarter sessions rendered judgment that the will was her true will, but it was appealed to the Superior Court.  Their ruling was not found, but assumed to be that the will was denied and thus not recorded.

Jane Craig was also known as "Jinny"

Andrew C. Murdock James Murdock Mary Ann Murdock

[Estate Papers - Deposition of Thomas Scott 24 Apr 1840 (modern spellings)]

[top portion obscured]
...
from the Superior Court of Said County impow=
-ering us to take the Deposition of Thomas Scott
Esqr. to be read in evidence in the Suit now
pending in Said Court Wherein Jane Craig is
plaintiff & Andrew Murdock and others
defendants.  We have this day cause the said
Thomas Scott to appear before us in the store
House kept by the said Scott at Ruffins Mills
in Orange County.  One this 25th day of April 1840
and the Said Scott being duly Sworn deposeth
and says he is aged about Sixty Seven Years
of age[sic]. that he was well acquainted with
Margaret Murdock Decd. And that his acquaintance
commenced before he was grown.

That ins the early Part of April 1837 he was
in Company with the Deced. at her Dwelling house
and had considerable conversation with her
that she then had the appearance of being Very
aged and infirm and had lost her hearing
to such an extent that it was Very difficult
to make her understand that she could more
easily understand when spoken to by one of
the family - That she spoke of Writing her will,
and requested him to write it for her observing
that after her debts were paid she would have
very little property left that her Daughter
Jane Craig had been Very good to her in
her old age and that she desired he[r] daughter
Jane should have the balance of her property
that remained after the payment of her debts
That Jinny was in debt herself and the property
which she might leave her would be taken to
pay those debts,  She requested that he property
might be willed to her friend Samuel Kerr
for the benefit of Jinny that the deponent

[page 2]
observed to Mrs. Murdock that he was doubtful
whether he could write such a Will in proper
form that he understood then was a bad state
of feeling existing between Jane Craig and her
sister Nancy and that an attempt might be made
to break the will and advised her to apply
to Doctor Craig who was better acquainted with
such matters - This deponent further states that
some time after the visit mention[ed] above he was again
at her house and had further conversation with
her that she observed that she was indebted to
James Mebane Senr. that said Mebane had desired
her to Secure his debt by a conveyance of her
property in trust - that she had declined
giving such a conveyance that a claim which this
deponent had upon her was not also secured
in the trust that she did that day sign a deed
in trust to secure said debts which was due
A T Bracken & Co. And of which this deponent
had the control -- This deponent further States that
on the first visit spoken of above in the early
part of Apr. 1837 supposing from her age and
apparent infirmity that she might not be acquainted
with the increased value of Slaves at that time
or indeed the value of any property and in
order to ascertain the correctness of her impressions
her[sic] proposed to by of her a small negro girl
which in former times could have been bought
for one hundred dollars and offered her
that[the] sum of two hundred dollars - she observed
that she could not sell her that she was her
little maid but if she were to sell her she would
not take less than two of three times the amount
offered
                               Thos. Scott

    We the undersigned Certify that
the above Deposition was taken before us

of the Peace for the County of Orange as set forth
in the caption thereto as Witness our hands
