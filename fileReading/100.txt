Additional Comments:
Wake County Will Book Volume 26, page 193
Recorded May 1847 (Wake County)

This will seems to have been written in Orange County, but it is not found in Orange County records.

The copy found among the estate papers seems to make more sense than the copy recorded in the will book.  There are many differences between the two. Differences are noted with square brackets [], and "EP:" tag. For instance, the transcription reads: "they shall at their own discussion[EP: discretion] dispose of".  The will book version is clearly written as " discussion", but that does not make sense.  The estate paper version says "discretion". It could be that the original will was wrong, or that the will book transcriber made a mistake.  It could also be that the estate papers transcriber decided to write what was intended rather than what was literally written.  Without referring to the original, it cannot be determined precisely.  However, the "Martha" listed in the will book is written as "Martin" in the estate papers, and "Martin" in the related will book references (transcribed below), so there is that point to consider.

Estate sale was recorded in Wake County Will Book Volume 26, page 260-261

Estate papers for Orange County: the papers for this estate are mis-filed in the folder "Laws, George (1815)" who is the father of this testator, and this testator was one of his father's executors.  The original will is not listed in the loose wills of either Orange or Wake County.
