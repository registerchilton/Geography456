Recorded Feb 1848

Note 1: "buggy" is written in a mostly-illegible scrawl, and in the will book version, this is rendered as "horses".  Since this appears in a list of other equipment, it would appear that this is "buggy".

refractious: (archaic) Obstinate and unruly; strongly opposed to something.

The handwriting is the same as many of this era.  Appears to be J. W. Norwood's handwriting, one of the witnesses, and a prominent Orange County attorney in matters of probate.

Estate Papers comprise 14 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Hooker, Nathan (1852)".  Octavius Hooker listed as "O. W. Hooker" in papers...
