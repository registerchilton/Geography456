          To the Worshipful the Justices of the Court of
Pleas and Quarter Sessions for Orange County

                The Petition of David Humphrey and
                Betsey his wife, Eustace Humphrey and
                Phebe his Wife, and Nancy Busick
                            against
                William Busick Executor of the last
                Will of William Busick, late of Orange
                County, deceased,

Humbly Sheweth that William Busick late of Orange County
departed this Life in or about the year 1808, having
previously published in Writing his last Will, and therein
appointed William Busick his Son, and Henry Brannock
his Executors; the first of whom proved the said Will in
Orange County Court and took upon himself the burthen of
executing the Same; the said Henry Brannock has hitherto
refused to qualify as Executor - Your Petitioners shew that the
Testator by his Will, gave to his son Caleb 5/ to his Daughter
Elizabeth Wood 5/ To his Son in Law Samuel Green 5/ To his
Daughter Mary Wilcox 5/ To his Daughter Polly Corner
5/.- And directed that the remainder of his estate Should
be equally divided between his Son William, his Daughters
Betsy intermarried with one of your Petitioners David Humphrey,
Phebe intermarried with one of your Petitioners Eustace Humphrey,
                                                        (and

[page 2]
And Nancy Busick -  All of which will more fully
appear, reference being had to the said Will - Your Petitioners
shew that the Said William Busick the Executor possessed himself
of a large personal estate belonging to his Testator; And that he
hath failed to come to an Account with your Petitioners touching
the Same and to pay to them their respective distributive Shares
of the Said estate - Your Petitioners more particularly shew, that
the said William Busick was indebted to his Testator in the
Sum of one hundred Pounds or other large Sum, for and on
account of the Rent or purchase of a Tract of Land situate
in the County of Jones or Some County adjacent thereto, & that
he wholly refuses to account with your Petitioners for the Sum
- That he received of the assets of his Testator a Mare & Colt
and also a Cow, for which he hath not accounted -- And that
he hath received Since the Death of his Testator four hundred
Pounds, or other large Sum for an account of a Debt due
to his Testator by one Francis Hodge of Duplin County and
hath failed to account for the Same - Sometimes pretending
that as to this Debt due by Francis Hodge, that true it is the
said Francis Hodge owed his Testator four hundred Pounds or other large
Sum upon Bond; But that he the Said William placed the
said Bond for Collection in the hands of Daniel Lavender, who
received the ["said" x-out] Money due thereon, and failed to pay it over;
Whereupon he instituted Suit against the Said Lavendar and
obtained Judgment for the Amount of the Money by him received
                                                      (with

[page 3]
with Interest: that he hath received only two hundred Dollars of the
Said Judgment, & that Lavender hath absconded, leaving no property
out of which the Said Judgment could be Satisfied: & that he is excused
from any liability as to the balance due on the Said Judgment -
Whereas your Petitioners charge that if the said William hath
not received the balance due on the said Judgment, it is owing to his
own taches[See Note 1] and Neglect: for they charged that the Said Lavender
was arrested by the Sheriff of the County where he resided upon a Capias
ad Satisfaciendum issued upon the Judgment aforesaid, and by the Said
Sheriff was permitted to escape, Whereby the Said Sheriff became bound
to pay the Said Money: Or was arrested upon the Capias ad
Respondendum issued in the Said Case, and no Bail was taken
for his appearance;  Whereby the said sheriff became Special Bail
and liable to the recovery of the Plaintiff - And they charge that the
Said William hath made no Attempt to compel the said Sheriff
to pay the Said Money, Although he hath often been requested to take
all legal ways and Means to recover the Same - & they charge that
the Said William is bound to make good to your Petitioners the Said
Money, which he hath failed to recover by reason of his neglect,
And as to the Said Mare & Colt, and Cow, the said William
pretends that his Testator conveyed them to him before his Death, &
that he is not bound to account for the Same; Whereas your Petitioners
charge that no such Conveyance was ever made; or it if were
/which they do not admit/ it was mala fide and improperly procured
& therefore void  -- All which actings, Doings & Pretenses are contrary
to Equity & good Conscience and tend to the injury of your Petitioners
                                                             (To the

To the end therefore that the said William may upon his Corporal
Oath, full, true and perfect Answers make to all and Singular
the Premises and set forth what estate hath come to his hands, & how
he hath administered the Same, & that he may be decreed to come to
an Account touching the said estate and to pay over to your
Petitioners what shall be due thereon; & that your Petitioners may
have Such other and further relief in the premises as is equitable
and Right, May it please your Worships to grant to your
Petitioners the Writ of Subpoena, directed to the Said William, command-
=ing him &c to be &c And Your Petitioners as in duty bound

A Judgment was obtained in Jones County Court by
William Busick the elder against Daniel Lavender
I was attorney for the Pltf In the course of the trail
it was discovered that Lavender had committed Forgery
& the Court ordered him into custody.  He escaped &
left the state.  Some property which had belonged to
Lavender was held & claimed by others, but was sus=
=pected to be liable to Lavender debts & none other
but this disputed property was to be found - Mr Busick
proposed to pay me a certain{?] proportion to the sum
which I might collect, if I would undertake the
collection of the judgment by subjecting the disputed
property - I agreed to make the attempt, &
attended the sale of the property in Jones County - a
stud horse was offered for sale, claimed ( I believe by
Ro. Reynolds Esqr.) - I bid the horse off - but afterwards
Reynolds agreed to give me his note for two hundred
dollars (which I believe was a little more than I bid
the horse off at). I took his note for that Sum -

    When the note was paid with interest it amounts
to Two hundred & ten dollars eighty seven cents $210,87.
of this sum I was entitled by the agreement of
old Mr Busick to one forth, say thirty five dollars
seventeen cents ------------------------------- $35.17
