Additional Comments:
There are two copies in the Will Book Volume E:
Will Book Volume E, page 388
and
Will Book Volume E, page 402
Recorded Aug 1836

Two different copies of the will in the will book have different legatees.

Estate Papers comprise 118 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Moore, James (1836)". It appears that estator died in Jul 1836.  Testator's son Robert died before the testator died.  Hosea C. Smith died in September 1841, leaving James and William Smith as Hosea C. Smith's only heirs.  John Moore was appointed administrator.  Deposition asked when the will was written, and the answer was in the winter of 1833 or 1834.  Robert Moore wrote the will.  Patsey Smith died before Hosea in 1841.  Various petitions complain of lack of documentation or accounting for the estate of this testator and his daughter Patsey.  There are numerous mentions of the "hire of negroes" in various ledgers.
