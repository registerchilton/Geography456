John J. Carrington purchased Peggy Cary's portion of the estate and was guardian to Nancy Cary

Extremely hard to read.  Letters poorly formed, missing, non-standard spellings.
On back: Proved Novr. Term 1819

Note 1: This appears to be "filley Briner / Cottle" in the original.  Possibly the name of the filly, or type of cow?  Brindle?

Note 2: Originally "Bengamon peggey and Anney"

Estate Papers comprise 49 pages and are found in folder entitled "Carey, Samuel (1819)". Samuel died intestate, which would explain why this will is not recorded in any will book

Wife's name is Rachel Cary.
Executor listed as "Rolling Cook" is Roland Cook
Children: Thomas Carey, Benjamin Carey, Peggy Carey and Nancy Carey (a minor in Nov 1822)
"Two slaves that have since his death increased"

In the partition of land, the Children and Heirs at Law of Samuel Carey are listed as Thomas, Benjamin, Margaret and Anne
