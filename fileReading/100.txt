Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume D, pages 25-26
Recorded Feb 1801

Original is very faded.

In the original, the scribe used "Tow" when the word "two" was meant.  The tanscriber into the Will Book didn't understand this and made the parts that refer to "My Two Youngest Sons" into "My son Youngest Sons", making this much harder to understand.

"Pansy" in the Will Book appears more linke "Fanny" in the original.

Also the Testator signs his name Clindenin

No estate papers found.
