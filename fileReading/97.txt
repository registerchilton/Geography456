Estate Papers comprise 205 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Crabtree, RIchard (1849)".  Per the testator's desires, Parthena Crabtree his widow who was also the administratrix sold the land on the Flat River to pay the debts of the estate.  It was purchased on 8 Nov 1851 by Harrison Parker and Squire D. Umstead for $1150.00, which did not satisfy the debts owed, so two more tracts of land were sold.  Parthena died about Nov 1857 before this estate was fully settled with Charles E. Russ appointed in her stead.  Final distribution seems to have been made in Dec 1861

to take an account of the administration
of the estate of said Richard Crabtree by Parthena

to the suit aforesaid to be notified to appear
before him at the office of the County Court
Clerk upon the 4th day of November 1859 and
having then and there considered the con-
flicting claims of said parties begs leave
to submit the following report.

    He find that the aforesaid Richard
Crabtree died in the year 1849 and that his
will was duly proved at May Term 1849
of Orange County Court that Samuel Bumpass
& Willie P Mangum named as his Executors
therein ["named" x-out] renounced their right to
Qualify as such whereupon Parthena
Crabtree widow of Said Richard was
appointed Administratrix with the will annexed
and entered into bond with Abner Parker
& Nelson Rhew as sureties that at Fall Term
of Orange Superior Court Said Administratrix
filed a petition alledging[sic] that the personal

[page 2]
Estate of the said Richard & a tract of land --
divised for the purpose had been ex[h]austed
in the payment of debts and there were still
outstanding debts and charges of administration
to the amount of $803.95 which rendered it
necessary to sell a mill & Tract of land
therein named, that Thomas J Latta & wife
Elizabeth William Hopkins & wife Susan William
Latta & wife Sally, William Crabtree Moses
Crabtree Green Babbit and Abner Parker
as Guardian of Clement John Richard Arther
Kemp & Lucy Ann Crabtree who were the
devisees & legatees under the Will of Said
Richard Crabtree were duly made parties
to said petition & that under the same such
proceedings were had that at ______ Term
____ said land was sold at the price of
$1150.  The commissioner further reports that
at February Term 1854 of Orange County Court
Said Parthena field a Second petition against
the devisees & legatees aforesaid excepting William
Hopkins who [was] dead & aledging[sic] that the minors
were without guardians in which it appears that
other debts amounting in all to $375.00 & charges
to the amount of $50 were due from the estate of
said deceased making it necessary to sell two
small tracts of land therein mentioned that the
said devisees & legatees were duly made parties to
said petition & such proceedings had thereon
that _____ Term ______ an order of sale was
made and the land sold for $331.40

    The Commissioner further reports that
in the inventory of Said Parthena filed in the
Clerks office of Orange County Court at
______ Term ______ she is charged with having

[page 3]
Received from the personal estate of the said Richard
and the land by him devised in order to pay
debts the sum of $1219.04 by her various
accounts current field at May Term 1851
November Term 1852 and Augt Term 1856
she is credited with $2975.20 of these credits
the sum of $1012.59 is made up of charges
against the minor children of said Richard
for Board from 1849 to 1855 thereupon..

    The sum of $85.54 in the account current of 1856
the sum of $12.00 in that of 1852 $42.60 & that of
1856 were unsupported by vouchers that in the
accounts current of 1851 & 1852 the vouchers
fell short in other items to the amount of $4.23
The Commissioner also reports that by the Will
of Said Richard Crabtree It is provided that
the rents issues & profits of the lands of the testator
other than that devised to be sold as aforesaid
should be applied to the support of his minor
Children

    If therefore that matter were open and he things
it is to his consideration the commissioner
would submit that the credits claimed
as above these should be rejected the items
for board and those following amounting
to $1156.96 which [w]ould leave the amount
for credits properly ["Chang" x-out] Claimable $1818.23
and that ["and that" x-out] ,, So there was due from said
Parthena at her death the difference betwixt
that sum and the amounts with which she
is charged (towit) $2700.45 being the value
of the personal estate & the land sold as aforesaid
if however the Commissioner has committed an
error in going behind the proceedings had

of $882.22 with Interest from 23rd November 1857
