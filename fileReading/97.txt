Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume D, pages 601-602
Recorded Aug 1821

Estate papers comprise 45 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Burton, Cuthbert (1822)". These state that Samuel Burton & William Burton, two of the legatees, died intestate in March 1825, and that John Burton, another legatee, died in April 1825.  Due to this and other circumstances, the settlement of the estate was a bit complicated and there were several legal actions associated with it, and as such, much more documentation was created, including several lists or inventories of the slaves mentioned.
