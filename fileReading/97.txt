Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume G, pages 143-144
Recorded May 1856

The name of the witness " James Holernan" on the loose will is clearly written and appears to be the same handwriting as the will itself, indicating that he was the scribe. In the will book version the signature is clearly "James Holeman".  Based on names found in other wills, it appears that the latter is correct.

Testator's signature in loose will is in the standard format for a "mark", whereas the will book version makes is appear that the testator actually signed the original.

Estate papers comprise 17 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Bowls, Nancy (1856)".  Inventory and estate sale.  No family history found.  Slaves appear to have all been bequeathed by the will.
