Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume F, pages 483-486
Recorded May 1851

Estate Papers comprise 85 pages and are found in a folder labeled "McBroom, Andrew J (1849)".  There was some dispute about whether the will valid, testator in in possession of his faculties, etc. Elizabeth Maddin deposition on 7 Mar 1850, states that she was "seventy six years old Last August"

Throughout these documents the name "Jiney" could be "Jincy"

The surname rendered here as "Jordan" appears variously, also resembling "Jorden" or "Jordon"
