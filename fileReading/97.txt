NB = Nota Bene

In the loose will, there is the phrase: "my Negro will be Sold.."  In the will book copy, it is written "my negroes will be sold".  The loose will version seems wrong, and thus the will book transcriber changed it.  However, a subsequent copy in a Petition found in the Estate Papers renders the original phrase as "my Negro Will be Sold..", so "Will" is the name of the negro, not a verb...  The assumption that the author of the petition knew the parties involved is a strong indicator that the word "Will" is actually the name of the slave, alternatively listed as "Bill" in some mentions in the estate papers.

Estate Papers comprise 103 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Peelor, Samuel (1822)".  In one petition the testator's surname is listed as "Peeler".

-sessed [illegible] entitled to a considerable personal

during her natural life, or widowhood, and after her

all to belong to my son Benjamin Peeler: All my
will is, that my son Benjamin when he comes of
age, that he have fifty Dollars, in money, out of

[page 2]
the price of the property that I shall leave to be sold
hereafter. Further, my will is, that my two other tracts
of land be sold, one Known by the name of the Mer-
-ritt tract of land and the other Known by the name
of "the Old Place" whereon Isley Browning now lives
Also, my will is, that my negro Will be sold and
my waggon and hind-geers, waggon cloth and feed-trough
and two stills and barrels and stands: this property
to be sold on a credit of twelve months, and the mo-
-ney to be equally divided between my five sons
that is to say Cader Peeler, Machael Sherman Peeler,
Pleasant Peeler, Anthony Redwine Peeler, and Thornberry
Peeler: only my daughter Sarah Peeler to have twenty
Dollars, out of the price of said property and my dau-
-ter Catherine Peeler to have one Hundred Dollars
out of the price of said property when she comes of
age: and all my just debts to be paid out of the

between the above mentioned five sons, that is to say
Cader, Micheal, Pleasant, Anthony, & Thornberry Pee-
ler" -- &c: and therein also appoint Moses McCown &
Moses Guess, executors thereof.
                               Your Petitioners fur-
-ther shew that shortly after making said last Will and
testament, the said Samuel Peeler, departed this lief, without
altering or revoking the same; and that the said Moses
McCown having refused to act, the said Moses Guess
qualified as sole executor thereof at ____ Term 1822
of Orange Court of Pleas & Quarter Sessions & Made sale of the pro-
-perty mentioned in said will; and at the sale of said pro-
-perty purchased the negro man slave Will, one of the
Stills, and the waggon, at his own sale, and afterward
treated and disposed of them as his own property, and sold
siad still and the said waggon sometime thereafter at private
sale at a considerable advance and still hold in his
possession the negro man slave Will.  You petitioners
further shew, that after payment of all his testators
debts, there remains in the hands of the said Moses Guess

[page 3]
a large amount for specification legacies and for distri
-bution among your petitioners, who have often times
in a friendly way by their said guardian, requested
him to come to a fair and candid settlement of the
accounts of this testator, and particularly set forth what
estate come to his hands, and how he hath disposed
of the same, and to make distribution and to account
with them for said negro Will, said still & waggon
and for the hire of said Man Will, and to pay over to
them, what shall appear to be justly due upon said
account: But the said Moses Guess refused to comply
with this reasonable request at one time pretending that
he has already paid over to your petitioners, all that
they are entitled to, under said will; and at other
times he pretends that he ought to be considered as the
purchaser and true owner of the negro man slave Will
the Still, & the Waggon, and only accounts for what he
bud them off at: But your petitioners are advised, that
such sale and purchase, are void, and that he hold said
negro, the Still & waggon, in his character of executor
and is bound to make sale and distribution of them ac-
-cording to the Will of his testator: all which actings and
doings of the said Moses Guess, are contrary to equity and
good conscience and highly wrongful to you petitioners.

    To the end therefore that the said Moses Guess may full
& true answer make to the premises, and to the further end
that he may be decreed to come to an account of the estate
of his testator and of his administration of the said, and to
make sale of & then distribute, or account for the full
value of said property bid off by him, at his own
sale, as aforesaid, and that your petitioners may have
such other and further relief, as to your Worships shall
seem meet, may it please your Worships, to grant to your
petitioners, the State's Writ of Subpoena to be directed to the
said Moses Guess, commanding him &c: to appear and
answer, and to stand to, and abide by & perform such
order and decree, as your Worships shall make in the
premises; & your petitioners will ever pray &c
                                 Scott
                                    Atto for Petition
                                    ers
