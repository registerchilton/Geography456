Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume D, pages 286-289
Recorded May 1811

This will is also recorded on pages 295-299 in the same will book.

There is no corresponding loose will in the NC State Archives.

Note 1: This phrase appears to be missing something in the first copy.

1) "I further lend unto my loving wife Nancy her life &c as above"

2) "I further lend unto my loving wife Nancy My Waggon during her life &c as above"

Note 2: Mason Tapley AKA Mason Tarpley was not dead at this time.  He died 6 Aug 1826.  The clerk made a mistake. Dead people don't give oaths in open court.  He was not listed as deceased in the second copy of the will.
