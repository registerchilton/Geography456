Estate Papers comprise 14 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Clendenin, William (1846)".  This appears to be a mix of this testator's papers some of which refer to deceased testator in 1838, so that cannot relate to the other William Clendenin who died circa 1844

Heirs are listed as Catharine Clendenin, Mary Clendenin, Nancy Clendenin, Benjamin Clendenin and Rebecca Clendenin.  These names are not in this will, and are part of a petition dated 1838
