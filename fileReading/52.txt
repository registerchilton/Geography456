Note 1: "Worn out preachers" may be describing a pension fund for retired or emeritus ministers.

Estate Papers comprise 48 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Kelly, John (1852)". Several documents shed light on the family and the slaves that they owned, some transcribed below.  The testator owned a tract of 610 acres, called the Nathaniel Patterson Tract and some of the papers refer to the division of this land.  If there is interest in this lineage, further examination of these papers would be warranted.

There is a large cross drawn at the bottom of the page near the signature.  The signature looks a lot like the handwriting of the rest of the document, so the large cross might be his mark, although it is not identified as such.
