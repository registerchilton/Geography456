Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume E, pages 117-118
Recorded Aug 1826

Note: There is a second copy of the will in the folder, copied by J. Taylor, CC.  The original is sufficiently clear that the second copy was not transcribed here.

The original, loose will was written on a sheet of paper that is approximately 12 1/2 X 15 3/4, probably designed to be folded in half lengthwise and written on the resulting four pages.  The writer wrote across the 12 1/2 width.  The person who made my copy at the archives chose to copy it onto two pages as transcribed above.

No estate papers found specifically for this testator, but Estate Papers comprising 108 pages were found in a folder labeled "Jackson, Isaac (1820)", some of which pertain to this estate.  Testator died in 1824, and the will was proved soon thereafter?  This doesn't match the 1826 date of the probate found in will book E.  If one is interested in this particular estate, look for papers with Benoni as Executor.  Note that Benoni Jackson was also the executor of Isaac Jackson, Jr (will dated 1814) and Levi Jackson was Executor for estate of Isaac Jackson (will dated 1820).
Elizabeth Jackson married Anthony Reynolds "of the state of Indiana"
Ruth Jackson married John Pickett "of the state of Indiana"

Mary Jackson married Joshua Thompson, Their children were:
James Thompson
Mary Thompson
Ruth Thompson who married James Thompson, son of John Thompson
Martha Thompson who married William Curry.
