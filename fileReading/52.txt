Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume E, pages 250-251
Recorded Aug 1831

The testator, Lydia Dilliard, appears to be Lydia Benton who married William Dilliard in about 1792.

Children listed in will:
Willis D. ("D" from estate papers)
Eliza     (Guardian account in estate papers)
Caroline M. (Guardian account and middle initial in estate papers)
Martha B. (Guardian account and middle initial in estate papers)
Mary Jane (Guardian account in estate papers)

The above girls are listed in this order in both the will and in the guardian accounts.  James Trice was guardian.  Estate papers list him as brother-on-law to Willis D.

Estate Papers comprise 96 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Dilliard, Lydia (1831)".  There is an unusually large number of accounts to the testator in these estate papers, therefore it appears that she was conducting a great deal of business.  There were minor children when Lydia died, to whom were appointed guardians, and their accounts are the source of many of the pages.

These legatees (all or some) were also legatees of Eliza Dilliard, adding to the size of this estate packet

Note 1: "Negro boy Warren" is listed under the costs of conducting the estate sale.  Unclear who he belonged to, but it appears that he was hired to assist with the sale - perhaps provide labor.  Other line items in this list include "Clearking at Sail" [clerking at sale].
