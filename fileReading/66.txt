Estate Papers comprise 23 pages and are found in folder labeled "Turrentine, Absalom (1856)". Ten slaves were enumerated in the inventory. Four slaves were willed to the widow.  Six slaves were named in the Division of Negroes.

The slave named Aaron in one version of the Division of Negroes was valued at $1000, however, it appears that in the final division he was not "worth anything".  Perhaps he was injured or otherwise incapacitated.

Per other sources, it appears that the widow's maiden name was Frances Wilson, who died in 1874, thus her probate records, if any, would not contain references to slaves.

In the Estate Papers of Absalom's brother, Daniel, it states that Absalom died in July 1856.
