Additional Comments:

Original will was written phonetically.

Will not found in Will Books of Orange County because it did not pass probate.  See Estate Papers.

Estate Papers comprise 22 pages and are found in folder labeled "Marcom, Isaiah P (1864)". Testator's full name is listed as "Isaiah Presley Marcom".  In Nov 1864, in a petition requesting her widow's allowance, Elizabeth Marcom, the testator's widow asserts that he "died about the 20th May last in battle near Petersburg" Virginia.  There are depositions in this folder which may interest those researchers who are focused on this lineage.

Orange County }
Probate Court } February ["Jany" x-out] 26th 1878

Be it remembered that on the 26th day of
["January" x-out] February 1878, Calvin O'Bryan and his
wife Eliza Ann propounded before
me for probate a paper writing purporting
to be the holograph will of the late Isaiah
Markham deceased of Orange County,
bearing date 25th February 1860, and proved
by three credible witnesses that said paper
and every part thereof including the he signa=
ture of said Markham was in his own
handwriting; And that the same was found
laid up in a book in an open shelf of
a book case in am open room without lock
to which every inmate of the house had free
acces.  And it was further proved that siad
Markham Kept his money title deeds notes
due to him and official papers as a justice
of the Peace, in an apartment of a chest
of drawers in a bureau, which had a lock to
it.  And that said Markham died 26 Decr 1864

    Upon this evidence (for which references made
to the depositions of the witnesses) I do adjudge that
said paper writing had not been established
by said proof to be the last will and testament

[page 2]
of said Isaiah Markham deceased: And
probate of the same as his will is therefore
refused: And I further adjudge that the said
propounders pay the costs of this proceeding
