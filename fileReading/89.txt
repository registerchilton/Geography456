Recorded Nov 1821

The text of the will appears to be the same handwriting as the signature of the testator.

No witnesses signatures on the will, so a court proceeding and an affidavit was necessary before this could be admitted to probate.

Estate Papers comprise 51 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Nicholson, Archibald (1822)".  The hire of the enslaved persons listed in the will is mentioned here.  Jude's name is also written Judith
