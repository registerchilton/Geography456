Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume F, pages 191-193
Recorded May 1844

Estate papers comprise four pages  and are found in a folder labeled "Clark, James (1844)".
These contain no slaves or other family history information  While the testator mentions "negroes" in the will as part of his estate, all seem to have been passed to family members without records in the estate papers.  Athony is listed by name in the will.
