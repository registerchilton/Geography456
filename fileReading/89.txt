Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume D, pages 525-526
Recorded May 1818

Note 1: " proved as a will of personals" is perhaps due to the fact that the will has only one witness, and therefore is insufficient to pass real estate.

Wife's name is Nancy and remarried after the testator's death.

The loose will file contained an additional handwritten copy of the will with more standard spellings labeled near the signature "a copy".  The copy is not transcribed here.

Estate papers comprise 36 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Latta, John (1818)".  After the the Administrator of this estate, Joseph Latta, died, there was still some $3600 left, so Robert Donnell was appointed to administer this testator's estate. Robert Donnell was also appointed guardian of Joseph's children.  Some papers relating to Joseph's and this testator's estates are found in a folder labeled Latta, John (1827) (29 pages)

[Estate Papers - Petition to Divide Estate and Slaves (undated)]

To the Worshipful the Justices of the Court of Pleas & quarter Sessions for
Orange County:

              The Petition Robert Donnell & his Wife Nancy Don
              -nell & of John Latta & Maria Latta (which John &
              Maria are infants under the age of 21 years respectively
              & petition in their behalf by their guardian & next friend
              Thomas Clancy Esp.) -  against -

                         Joseph Latta. ~~

Humbly petitioning shew unto your worships your petitioners Robert
Donnell & his wife Nancy of Guilford County & John Latta & Maria Lat-
-ta both of Orange County, that John Latta late of Orange County duly made
his last will & testament in writing bearing date the 8th day of February
1817, executed in proper form to pass personal property, and thereby bequeath-
-ed to his then wife Nancy Latta "the one third part" of his Estate & the
"two thirds thereof to his two children John and Moria" & appointed John Cabe
& John Latta Senr. the Executors thereof: That the said The Testator shortly there
after died in Orange County without altering or revoking the said Will, which
was afterwords, viz at May Term 1817 of this worshipful Court duly proved as
a will of personals[Note 1] & recorded in this Court: That before the said Term of
this Court John Cabe one of the Executors named in the said Will also
died; and at the same Term aforesaid, John Latta Senr. the other Execu-
-tor in open Court did renounce the said Office in due form of Law:
That thereupon Letter of administration of the personal Estate of said Testator with the will annexed were
granted & issued by the same Court to Joseph Latta of said County of Orange
who ["thereupon" x-out] accepted the same & undertook the burden of administer
-ing the said Estate --- You petitioners further shew, that your petitioner
Nancy (who was the widow of the said Testator & hath since intermarried
with your other petitioner Robert Donnell) did at the same May Term
1817 in due form of Law & in open Court enter her dissent from the said
will & the same was recorded - Your petitioners further shew that the
said Testator had & was possessed at the time of his death of a large
personal Estate of the value of Five Thousand Dollors or other large
sum, consisting of Slaves, Crops, Stock, Debts & other things, which come
to the hands of the Said Joseph Latta, who has collected & sold
& disposed of the other articles, except the Slaves, in a course of adminis
-tration & has hired out the slaves & received the proceeds thereof: That
the Slaves have increased to the number of Eight & are called by the names
of Dick, Charles, Peggy, Lela & her infant Child, Jesse, Charlotte, and
Major: They admit that the Testator was indebted to some small amount
but they suppose that the said administrator hath long since discharg-
-ed the same, as he ought to have done -- Your petitioners shew, that
they are advised that the clear residue of the Estate belongs in Equity to them
& ought to be divided equally between the said Nancy, John & Moria, share &

[page 2]
share alike & that they are desirous of having the said Slaves in particular
divided specifically between then -- They further shew, that there is in
the hands of said Joseph a large unrefunded[?] balance of money, after
payment of all the Debts of the Testator & all lawful charges: And that they
have often applied to him to come to an account with them in the premises
& pay to them respectively what might due to each of them & also to divide the
said Slaves among your petitioners as aforesaid & deliver them over
& well hoped that said Joseph would so di in all respects, as in Equity her
ought: But so it is, that said Joseph hath heretofore wholly failed & re-
-fused to do so, pretending that there are debts unpaid & that he hath nothing
in hand but the slaves & that he cannot take on himself to divided them
but under the Direction of a Court of Justice by reason of the Infancy of
you petitioners John & Moria: By all which doings your petitioners are
aggrieved. [???? In as?] much as there are remediless except in this worship
-ful Court, where such matter are relievable; And to the End, that the
said Joseph may full true & perfect answer make on Oath to all & singular
the premises & may come to the Account aforesaid with your petitioners
& pay over what may be found to be justly due to each of them & that the
Slaves may, under the ???order of your worships, be equitably valued &
divided as aforesaid & the share of each one delivered over to him or her
& that your petitioners may have other competent relief according to
the exigency of there case, May it please your worships to grant to
your petitioners the State's Writ of Subpoena to be directed to the said Joseph
Latta commanding him to be & appear at the next term of this
worshipful Court & be held on &c at &c then & there to stand to &c ac
-cording to Equity, the rules of the Court & the Law of the land. And
your petitioners will every pray &c ---
                                     Robert Donnell, for self & Wife
Ruffin Solr. for petitioners
                                     Thomas Clancy, guardian
                                     for Infant petitioners
