Recorded May 1828

In the original will there are several insertions that are written in very small letters and overwrite themselves.  The Will Book version is somewhat different in these areas - both versions are included.

Estate Papers comprise 273 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Garrard, Samuel (1828)".  Tyre Garrard and William Horner were appointed Administrators of this estate. Almost no family history was discovered within this material.  It seems to primarily be the paperwork concerning numerous unpaid bills and accounts due by the Testator, and demands that the Administrators pay the bills by selling the lands - three tracts of 50, 78, and 300 acres - that the Testator passed to various legatees, due to the fact that there was no other property or assets remaining.

It appears that the Testator was the last surviving partner of a mercantile business and tried to pass the business with its debts to the son of his partner and that failing, the debts reverted to his personal estate?
