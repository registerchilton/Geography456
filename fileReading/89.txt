Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume E, pages 241-242
Recorded Feb 1831

Note 1: The entry in the will book does indeed say 1830, however the entries before and after say 1831...  It appears that 1830 is an error, because the will was written in Jan 1831.

Note 2: "to N.M.C." seems to indicate that the slave was purchased for Nathaniel M. Carrington, but it is unclear whether this refers to the line above or below the notation.

Estate Papers comprise 43 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Carrington, Nathaniel (1830)".  Six slaves were who were not mentioned in the will were sold on 2 Nov 1831.  After realizing that the estate was still indebted, the Ephraim Carrington, the administrator petitioned the court to sell the slaves who were specifically bequeathed to various legatees.  That sale was held on 23 Jan 1834 as noted above. Testator owned land in Granville, so perhaps some pertinent records may be found there.

These papers seem to indicate that the testator had experienced a forfeiture of a £6,000 bond - there was an appeal granted, so final outcome is unclear, but the subsequent forced sale of the bequeathed slaves may be as a consequence of this.
