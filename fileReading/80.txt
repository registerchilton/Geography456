Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume A, pages 264-268
Recorded Nov 1783

There seems to be a variety of opinions as to the married name of Ann Christmas.
The original loose will appears to be "Picttes", will book copy: "Pictles" Additionally, her husband was a witness.  Original: "Pickhart", Court Clerk's note on the original and in will book: "Pickhart", will book signature Pickat.

Phillimon in original is Philamon in the will book
Ginna in the original is Ginny in the will book
Will in the original is Wise in the will book
Fanna in the original is Fanny in the will book

The writer of the loose will often leaves the ends off of words - plurals, final 'e', etc. - but does so inconsistently.  Seems like all words that begin with 'b' or 'l' are capitalized.  Many proper nouns not capitalized.

Estate Papers comprise 3 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Christmas, John (1784)". Inventory found in lists miscellaneous property. Inventory, recorded Feb 1784lists "Nineteen Negroes"
