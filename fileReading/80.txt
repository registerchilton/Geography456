Recorded Aug 1839

Estate Papers comprise nine pages and are found in folder "Brown, William (1841)".  Do not confuse this estate with an earlier estate: Brown, William (1833), which is for an intestate William Brown with wife Lydia.

During the arbitration to settle the disputes in the estate, the negro boy Stephen was sold in 1841 due to the death of Miss Polly Brison, as part of the distribution of the estate.  Brison is not mentioned in the will, but there is a Polly Ann Cabe.  A slave by the name of Stephen - perhaps the same person - had been devised to Ruth Brown in the will.
