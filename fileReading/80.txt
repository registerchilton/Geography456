Recorded May 1838

Estate Papers comprise 25 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Veazy, Ezekiel (1844)".  Testator died in 1846.  This date appears t o be incorrect.  Assuming these papers pertain to this testator, the probate date of May 1838 does not match the statement concerning the death date found in these estate papers.  Elijah Hester is the executor, and Frances is wife in both cases.

Jemimah married Green Mangum.  She died prior to Nov 1846
Testator's youngest child died underage.

On 18 May 1844 Negro woman Lucy was sold to George Riggs for $430.00
