Additional Comments:

Recorded Jan 1821

Note 1: Many writers of this era use a long S for every every "s" that appears within a word (i.e. when the "s" is not at the beginning or end). The writer of this will uses a stylized S followed by a lower case "s" to indicate "ss" such as in the word "issue" or "necessary", and uses it in the name, clearly written, as "Levena Issabella". The will book version of this will renders the name with the more common spelling of "Lavinia Isabella".

Another item of note is that her surname is spelled "Bryan", while her mother's surname is first "Bryant", then "Bryan".  Both surnames appear scattered throughout the Estate Papers.

The use of the phrase "supposed daughters" is unusual. Perhaps these were step-daughters - regardless, it appears that the testator is not the biological father.

Original will has "Elisabeth", will book copy has "Elizabeth"

Estate papers comprise 116 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Lapslie, James (1820)". State that the testator died in 1821 or alternatively 1820,  Brothers of testator listed as Thomas D? Lapslie died in Georgia, and James.  Sister Elizabeth died in Orange.

Lavinia Isabella Bryan born 24 Jan 1810, died 24 Apr 1885 and is buried in Cedars Cemetery in Milton, NC.  Per the estate papers married Nathaniel J. Palmer 20 July 1826

    To the Honorable the Judge of the Said Court

                  The Petition of Sally Bryant
                            Against
                  Thomas Armstrong and Willie Shaw
                  The exrs. of James Lapslie decd

    Humbly complaining sheweth unto your Honor that James
Lapslie late of the County of Orange departed this life about
the year ______ having previously made and published his last
will and testament in writing duly made according to
the laws of this state to pass both his personal and real
estate --- and that among other devises and bequeaths made in
the said will by the said Testator is the following to your
petitioner, "I loan to Salley Bryant (mother of my two sup-
posed daughters) one negro woman named Sylvia for
and during the term of her natural life, and after her
decease I give and bequeath the said negro woman and her
increase to my two supposed daughters Livinia Issabella Bry-
ant, and Lousia Jane, and to the survivor of them as herein
after directed."

        Your petitioner further shews that the said Sylvia
after the publication of the said will, but bifore[sic] the death of
the testator had issue, Lucy: and that the said testator in his said
will appointed Thomas Armstrong and Willie Shaw his exec-
utors who ["took" x-out] proved the will in Orange County Court where it is
now of Record, and took upon themselves the burthen of execu-
ting the same - and there came to the hands of the said executors
more than sufficient property to pay off all the debts of
the deceased, without abating any of the legacies given by the

[page 2]
said will; and your petitioner further shews that the said exc-
cutors took into their possession the said Lucy, the child of the wo-
man Sylvia who was left to your petitioner - and that the said
executors assented [?] to the said legacy of Sylvia Now your pe-
tioner shews that she is advice that she is entitled under the
clause of the will above recited to the said Lucy during
her life as a part of the increase of the said Sylvia --
that the said Lucy is not ["specifically" x-out] disposed of by any other
part of the said will - and she had hoped that the said ex-
ecutors would have dilivered[sic] her over according to the benevolent
intention of the testator plainly expressed: But the said executors
have whol[l]y refused to do though often request thereto - For the
end therefore that the said executors may be decreed to deliver
up the said Lucy to you petitioner, and account for her an-
nual hire - and that such other and further relief may
be granted to your petitioner as in the premises she is entitled to-
may it please your Honour to require the said Armstrong and
Shaw to appear at the next term of this court to be held for the
County of Orange at the Court House in Hilllsborough on the second
Monday of March next, then and there ["to pl" x-out] upon their corpo-

       The Petition Nathaniel Palmer & Lavinia Isabella
       Palmer his wife

                      Humbly sheweth unto your worships
Your Petitioners, that James Lapslie late of the County of Orange &
father of your Petitioner Lavinia Isabella Palmer departed this
life early in the year 1821 having previously made & published
his last will & Testament, which said will at the time of his death
was unrevoked & was, by the Exrs. therein named to wit Thomas
Armstrong & Willie Shaw, at February Term 1821 of Orange
County Court duly proven & then qualified as such Executors
& took upon themselves the burthen of executing the same -
that they in performance of their duties took into their possn.
all the personal property of their Testator to a very large
amt. & proceeded to administer the same by paying off
the debts due from the estate & paying & delivering over the specific
legacies mentioned in the said will to the several distributees,
that at _____ Term of Orange County Court the before-
mentioned Willie Shaw was by order of said Court ap=
=pointed Guardian to Your Petitioners Lavinia Isabella
then Lavinia Isabella Bryan & to her infant sister Louisa
Jane Bryan & their said guardian took into his hands all
the property both real & personal belonging to them -- That
by said will their father devised to them a valuable tract of
Land & several Negroes, part of which Land & Negroes were
divised to Elizabeth Lapslie the sister of said Testator for her
life time - & the part devised to them & the whole after the death
of the said Elizabeth Lapslie as well real as personal was to
be hired out & the proceeds applied to the use of your Petitioners
Lavinia Isabella & her Sister Louisa Jane - as will
now fully appear by reference to said Will now upon record
in this Worshipful Court - they would further Shew that in
said will is contained the following clause, towit, - "I give
" & bequeath to my Executors hereinafter named my tract of

[page 2]
" piney Land on the head waters of Eno & Back Creek to be sold, to=
" gether with all my stock of every description & after the payment of all my
" just debts, the residue of the money arising from the sale I give & bequeath
" to my said two supposed daughters to be laid out in their education
" & support together with the hire of the Negroes bequeath & given to
" my daughters as aforesaid" -- that the aforesaid Elizabeth Lapslie
survived her brother the said James Lapslie but a very short
time, having died in the month of ___________ in the year 1821 -- & the
said Executors took into their possessions as well the property devised
to your Petitioners Lavinia & her sister Louisa as that which was
devised to the said Elizabeth -- Your Petitioners further shew unto
your Worships, that the said James Lapsly died possessed of a
very large stock consisting of horses, hogs, cattle & sheep as well
in the County of Orange as in other places, particularly in
Georgia - All of which the said Executors sold together with the
piney wood land mentioned in the above devise - & that the
proceeds after paying the debts of the testator, which are, as
they are informed & believe, few & unimportant, paid & delivered
over by Thomas Armstrong one of the Executors to Willie Shaw
as guardian of your petitioners Lavinia Isabella & her sister
Louisa Jane - Further complaining Your petitioners shew unto
Your Worships that they were married the 20th day of
July in the [year] 1826 & your Petitioner Nathaniel Palmer being
desirous to have in his care & possession the property belonging
to him in right of his Wife has repeatedly called on the said
Willie Shaw as the guardian of his wife to account with & pay
over to him his share of the rents of said land & the hire of the
Negroes & his moiety of the proceeds of the sale of the piney wood
land & the stock - & has also applied to him as the guardian
of Louisa Jane Bryan the sister of his wife your Petitioner to
divide & deliver to him his moiety of said lands mentioned in
said Will & also the Negroes - The first request he has refused
alleging at times that the proceeds of the sale of said land
& stock has not yet been collected, nor the debts paid - whereas
Your Petitioners shew that the money due upon said sales
has long since been paid to the said Willie Shaw and
that all the debts due from the Estate of the said James

[page 3]
Lapslie have long since been paid off, or if such be not
the fact that the said Willie Shaw has been guilty of great
negligence in the discharge of his trust as more than eight
Years have elapsed since the death of the said James -
As to the second request he has declined it upon the grounds
that Your Petitioner Lavinia Isabella not being yet of
age, the time has not arrived at which by the provissions
of said Will, the property is to be divided - Whereas your
Petitioners contend that upon their intermarriage, they are
entitled to have their share of the property devised both
real & personal divided between[& allotted] them -- Your Petitioners
therefore pray, that the said Willie Shaw may be compelled
upon his Corporal Oath to set forth & state what property
both real & personal belonging to the Estate of the said
James Lapslie decd. has come to his hands either as Executor of
the said James or as Guardian of your Petitioners Lavinia
Isabella Palmer & her sister Louisa Jane - how he has
used the same - if rented out, for what sums did it rent,
& to whom - what was the amount of the Sales of the piney wood
land & the stock - what was the amount of the debts against
the Estate - & what sum was in his hands after payment of
said debts as guardian of your Petitioners Lavinia Isabella
& her sister Louisa Jane - that the said Wilkie Shaw
may be decreed to account with & pay over to Your Petitioners
their share or portion of the proceeds of the sale of Said
piney wood Land & Stock and also their share of the hire
of the Negroes & rents of the Land, that they may have allotted
to them their share of the Lands & Negroes so left to Your
Petitioner Lavinia Isabella - May it please Your
Worships to grant to your Petitioners the states Writ of
Ssubpoena to be directed to the said Willie Shaw & to the
said Louisa Jane Bryan to be served on the said
Willie Shaw her guardian commanding them to be and
appear before this Worshipful Court at the succeeding
Term thereof to be held for the County of Orange at the Court
