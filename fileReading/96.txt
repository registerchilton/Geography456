Recorded May 1815

"Abner" appears to have been an enslaved person.

Alternates spelling the word "son" as "son, "sone" and "sane"

Mark of the testator as a signature indicated in this transcription with (O), but was a large somewhat circular mark, perhaps due to health reasons listed in the will.  The spelling of in the body of the will of the testator's surname is "Montgomery", but the signature line, written in the same handwriting as the body of the will, has it clearly written "Mongomery"

Estate Papers comprise 10 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Montgomery, William (1815)".
