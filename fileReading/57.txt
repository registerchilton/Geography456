Will of Thomas Ruffin - 16 Apr 1865

I Thomas Ruffin, of Alamance County in North Carolina, do make and
publish this paper writing as my last Will & testament. --

    In the first place, I gave some year ago to my Daughter Catha
-rine Roulhac the House & Lots in Hillsborough, on which she reside, as an
advancement, but have not yet conveyed them.  Therefore I devise the same
to her in fee simple.-

    In the second place, Mr. Paul C Cameron purchased from me sever
-al years past the piece & parcel of land, adjoining the town of Hillsborough,
on which he resides, being the residue of the land conveyed to me by
George Pollok, which I have not hereto fore conveyed to William Cain
of the said Cameron, and paid me therefor, but I have not yet made
him a deed  Therefore I do hereby devise the same to the said Paul C.
Cameron in fee simple.  And I gave to the said Cameron a piece of
land adjoining the lands of Pratt, Heart & others in Orange County, in-
-cluding the while tract I there owned expect a parcel which I had sold
& conveyed to Pratt: which gift was by way of advancement to my daught
-er Anne, wife of said Cameron, but I have not yet conveyed it.  Now,
to complete said gift, I do hereby devise the said land to the said Paul
C. Cameron in free-simple.

    At the beginning of the present publick trouble my property was
sufficient for providing a comfortable competency for my wife and chil-
-ren, yet in the present state of things I find it out of my power to set a
value on the different part of my Estate & property, on which I can base
a satisfactory distribution among them specifically or in value.  Hence
I think it is best, under the circumstance, for my children, that what
I have should be kept in consolidated form in the hand of their
Mother (who has been as good & as affectionate Wife & Mother as
husband or children ever had) so that she shall succeed me as the Head
of the Family; and, moreover, because it is, at all event, my wish and
purpose to provide for her, according to my ability, such a subsistence
& endowment as will ensure to her the means of living as she has
been accustomed or as near it as may be, & also to be bountiful
to [blot out] her children & their families according to their necessities
& her judgment & discretion; and therefor I have advisedly deter-
-mined to give and I do hereby give to my fond & cherished wife,
Ann M. Ruffin, in fee simple & absolute property at law & in equity
the whole Residue of all my Estates & effect, rights & credits - mean-
                                                               /-ing

[page 2]
-ing hereby to leave nothing undisposed of, but to rest the whole residue legal
& equitable in my wife, who deserves all the affection & honour I have ever
felt for her or could feel.  But I hereby confirm the gifts of certain slaves which
I have heretofore made: that is, to my Son Peter Brown of the girl Anny [Amy?]; to my
Son in law John W. Brodnax of the girl Patty; to my son John K of the
man Peter; and to my son in law Edmund Ruffin Jr. of the woman Susan
& her child. - I appoint my sons Sterling, Peter Browne, & Thomas & my
Sons in law Paul C. Cameron &  John W. Brodnax the Executors of
this will, expressing the hope & expectation that they will claim no pecu
-niary compensation for any service that they may or can render to so ex-
cellent a Mother. -- In testimony whereof I do hereby set my and to
this writing, all in my own hand writing, this 16th day of April 1865.--
