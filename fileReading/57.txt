Recorded Feb 1815

Note 1: enceint is enceinte, which is a synonym for pregnant.

Estate Papers comprise 109 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Evans, Henry (1814)". These papers assert that Henry died intestate, in a petition dated September 1815.  He died in November 1814, but in other papers mention the will as if it were in force.

In August 1820 a petition was made to the Court of Pleas and Quarter Sessions including: Elizabeth Evans, widow of Henry Evans later married Andrew Cole.  Asa Evans is listed as Henry's "only issue", so the child she was expecting when the will of written didn't survive. Chesley Page Patterson had died intestate "a few months since" with Lemuel Morgan appointed his administrator.

As per the will "Gabrel", known as "Gabriel" in the estate papers, was hired out for several years.  He was known as a skilled shoemaker.

Silvia and her child, Kimbro were not mentioned in the estate papers, and it is assumed that they passed into the possession of Asa Evans.  No will or estate papers found for him?  Also looked for Asa Evans in Wake County per references to land there.  Also used alternate surname spellings for estate papers of Ivins and Ivans.
