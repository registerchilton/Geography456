     I give and bequeath to my nephew Samuel
Goodwin of the Town of Fayetteville and his Heirs and
assigns forever my Houses and Lotts in the town of Hills
borough with all the appurtenances thereto belonging ------

    I devise all the rest and residue of my

ture wheresoever the same may be to my Executors here
in after named, to be sold at such time and in such
manner as in their discretion will be most advantage
ous for those for whom the proceeds are intended ----------

    I give and bequeath to my eldest Bro
ther Barnet Tatom the Sum of Two thousand dollars
to my nephew Samuel Goodwin the Sum of Two Thou
sand dollars and to my Sister Elizabeth Hicks of
Granville County the Sum of One Thousand dollars
to be paid out of the proceeds of the Sales above directed

my will and desire that if any of the children of my deceased
Brothers and Sister shall have died [x-out] bearing Children, then
that such children stand in the place of and represent their deceas
ed Parent; and it is further my will and desire, that in all there
cases the Sum of Money given to the children of a deceased Brother
or Sister, be divided among them equally share & share alike

     Item I give and bequeath to my said
Nephew Samuel Goodwin, all the furniture and other things
belonging to my Houses in Hillsboro' except such as are specifi

[page 3]
cally given away to the other persons, and it is ??? true meaning and
Intent, that what is hereby given to the said Samuel Goodwin be
held and considered to be over and above what I may have here
to fore advanced to him or for his Use --------------

    I give and bequeath to my friend John Hogg
my gold watch key and Seal ----

    I give and bequeath to my friend Duncan
Cameron my law-Books

    I desire my Executors to pay to Sarah a nagro
woman Slave the property of James Hogg Esquire, the Sum of twelve
pounds as a reward for his Attention to me in my Illness

    Whereas two tracts of land entered in the
office of John Armstrong both in my name, one of which containing
four Thousand five Hundred and thirty Acres or thereabout, was
purchased, and is apparently my property but in reality is held to
the use of sundry persons as will appear by Papers in my possession
It is my Will and desire that my Executors do convey to the
persons so intevested their respective Grants, warranting only five
Persons claiming by, from, or under me, but no further, or other
wise ---  The other Tract of Three thousand Acres granted to me
for my Services as Commissioner a second time for laying out
Army lands - of this I have sold five Hundred Acres to old
Mr. _____ Martin of Davidson County in the State of Tennessee
if not already conveyed to him by John Nichols and Genl ????
Robertson by virtue of a power of Attorney heretofore granted them for
that purpose. -- it is my Will and desire that my Executors do
convey to Mr Macklin said lands out of such part to the Tract as
he may choose -- one half of the remainder belongs to Genl Ro
bertson as a Compensation for his Service in locating and surveying
said lands which I desire my Executors to convey to him or his Heirs

    And for the purpose of ascertaining the true Interests
which William Moore and myself have in certain lands lying in
The County of Randolph, I think it right and just to declare that
a tract of land containing two Hundred and fifty Acres being
a part of a tract known by the name of Lowes, and a tract of two
Hundred Acres afterwards entered adjoining thereto on the South and
for which a Grant was obtained in my name alone; are the joint
property of said William Moore & myself & held by us as Tenants
in Common -- adjoining to these two tracts on the North as one con-
taining Eighty Acres, bought of one Rush[?] this is my sole property
-after the War the said William Moore and myself entered
jointly a tract of land in said County containing Six hundred
and forty Acres including the cross Roads leading from Salisbury

[page 4]
to Fayetteville, and from Randolph old Court House to Firkins
Camp on Yadkin River, a Grant was obtained in my name
alone, but Mr Moore is equally concerned as tenant in common

    It is further my Will and desire, that after the death
of old George & Kate his Wife, the plantation demised[?] in trust for
the use of my Negroes shall be equally divided between Jack & Sally
or their Heirs respectively; but if young George should reform to the
satisfaction of my Trustees, they may at their pleasure give him an
equal share with Jack & Sally or their Heirs in said tract of land,
but the same During the life time of old George & Kate is not to be
divided -----------

    In the management and disposal of
my land in the State of Tennessee I recommend to my Execu
tors to request the apertance[?] of my friends Major Abraham
Manny and Genl. Daniel Smith, and desire that just Com
pensation may be made to them for whatever services they may
render in relation thereto --

    All the residue of my Estate which
shall remain after the payment of my debts and the legacies
herein specifically devised, I desire may be divided among
and between my Brother Barnett Tatom, Alma Tatom, John
Tatom, William Tatom, my Sister Elizabeth Hicks  my Nephew
Samuel Tatom, and the children of my deceased Brother
Abel Tatom, and the children of my deceased Sisters Henrie
etta Fulbylove[?], and Kesiah Goodwin alias Newby, Samuel
Goodwin excepted who is provided for as abovesaid, share and
share alike; and where any of [?] my Brothers are dead
it is my Will that his children should represent him, and
when any of the children of a deceased Brother or Sister have
died leaving children it is my Will that the Children of
such deceased child should stand in his or her place and
take accordingly ----

    Lastly I constitute and appoint Sa
muel Goodwin, John Hogg, Catlett Campbell and Dun
can Cameron Executors of this last Will and Testa
ment, hereby revoking all former Wills --- In Testimony of
all which I have hereto set my Hand & Seal this 17th decem
