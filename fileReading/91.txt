Note 1: Proclamation Money was coin valued by a proclamation of Queen Anne on 18 June 1704 and was in effect until 1775. Colonists and colonial governments recorded their accounts in pounds, shillings, and pence but used a variety of coins in their transactions, including the Spanish pieces of eight and the French silver écu, AKA dollar. Under the proclamation, the various colonial exchange rates for Spanish pieces of eight, the most common coins in the American colonies, were assigned a uniform valuation of six shillings.
