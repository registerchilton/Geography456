Recorded Nov 1824

The writer of this will used many commas in the text - most not in accordance with modern usage.  Also spellings inconsistent throughout "dollers" vs "dollars", "bequeath" in some places vs. "bequath" in others (not unusal for this era).

No estate papers found.  Note that the estate papers for various Latta testators are somewhat mixed up in the 1820s, so it may be beneficial to re-examine these.
