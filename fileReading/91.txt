Despite the date of this will, the handwriting is modern. Although the ink is faded, the will is clearly legible.  However, the words near right hand edge of the second page are all sufficiently obscured that the will book copy was used to determine what they are.

Frederick Moser is one of the founders of Saint Pauls Lutheran Church in Burlington, North Carolina.

No estate papers found.
