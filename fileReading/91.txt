Additional Comments:

Not found in Will Books, perhaps because only one witness signature.

"Gragstar" could also be Gregson, Gragston?

Estate Papers comprise three pages and are found in a folder labeled "Holt, George (1842)".  They are the appointment of Joel Boon as Administrator on 1 Mar 1842
