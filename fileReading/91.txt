An additional handwritten copy of this will in the archives.  Be sure to examine the original (look at the signatures).  There are a number of errors omissions and legibility issues in the handwritten copy

Estate Papers comprise 270 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Edwards, Henry (1850)".  These papers are more extensive than most estates because the legatees were not satisfied with the actions of the Executors. These papers record minutia mentioning slaves, their hire, medical care, transport, etc.  It is too extensive to fully document here.  If these lineages are of interest be aware there is more info in this estate packet.

Note 1: Not written very distinctly, but this is perhaps the same person as Warrick

Note 2: Moses 7 or 8 some 15 or 20 years before the death of Henry Edwards, Sr in 1850. Therefore Moses was born between 22 and 28 years prior, thus roughly in the year 1826

Note 3: Henry Edwards died "during the present year" per a petition in the November Term 1850

Note 4: previous wills revoked at the beginning and end of the will.  This is unusual.

Elizabeth Edwards married John Careathers.  He died and then she married John Cabe becoming Elizabeth Cabe.  With Careathers she had children William G. and Sarah
Mary Edwards married Stephen Lloyd
Susannah Edwards married Allen Robertson
Sarah Edwards married William Careathers.  Easy to confuse with children of Elizabeth Edwards and John Careathers

[Estate Papers - Answer to Petition Feb 1853]
Answer of Henry Edward filed at
February Term 1853 to the petition of
Stephen Lloyd & other against him & others
in Orange County Court

    This defendant for answer to said petition
saith that admits that he was first, guardian
of his father Henry Edwards sr and after his
death he qualified as one of his executors
as the bill charges at August Term 1850 of
Orange County Court - and has acted as one of his
executors.  Per the legacies given & the will of his fa=
ther and the general distribution of his estate
therein he refers to the will itself.  He shows that all
the negroes belonging to said estate have been
devided according to said will.  And as for
all the money legacies and the surplus of
the estate this defendant ready and anxious
to pay & settle the same at the earliest moment
he could do so, and made xxxx attempt to
do so before his two years were out, and this
petition has actually been filed against
him within the two years.  The defendant xxxx
to his returns of sales as guardian & executor and his
inventory as exr. further accounts of his fathers es=
tate which came to his hand,  This defendant has
in his returns accounted for & is ready to explain
and account for the notes of Allen Edward &
David Andrews mentioned in the petition.  He
did hire a boy to Morris[? Moses?] for $9.40 which he is ready to ac=
count for - He did not send negro Diana to Mrs Lloyd
but his father in his life time put said negro in her poss=
ession & this defendant took possession of him before his
death, Mrs Lloyd having voluntarily sent her back
& she waited upon her up to her death
He saith further the said note[vote?] of this: Faucett was

[page 2]
collected in the life of his father before defendant was
appoint his guardian & the money used in the
family.  As to the Boy Moses the defendant saith that
his father give him the said boy during the life
of his father where Moses was a small boy 7 or 8
years old, same fifteen or twenty years before  [Note 2]
the death of his father, & he always help him un=
der that arrangement his father never thinking of
asking him for Anne[?] He had placed a negro
also in the possession of Lindsey Edwards, another
in the possession of Elizabeth Caruthers, and
one in the possession of Mrs Delia Lloyd -

    As to the right of the parties plaintiffs & defendants
he refers to the will &c. The defendant is willing to submit to
an account &c.                            J.W. Norwood Att

Henry Edwards swears that the fact stated in this ["pet" x-out] answer
are of his own knowledge are true & the rest he believes to be true

[Estate Papers - Answer to Petition]
        The Joint and & several answer of John Edwards
        Executor of Henry Edwards Senior deceased
        & of Lindsey Edwards to the Petition
        of Henry Edwards and other exhibited
        in this Worshipful Court.
    These Defendants saving to for answer
to so much of said Petition as they are advi-
=sed it is material for them to answer, they
 answer & admit that the late Henry
Edward their father departed this life
about the time mentioned in the Petition
that the said Henry left a last Will
& Testament duly subscribed[?] to pass his
real and personal Estates which was admitted
to Probate in Orange County Court at the
Sessions mentioned in said Petition & that
the said Henry the Petitioner & Deft. John
were the Exrs named in said Will
who were at said term of the Court
duly qualified as Exrs. thereof & took
upon themselves the burthen of executing
the same. --- They further admit that
the next of kin & legatees under said Will
are correctly named in said Petition
They further answering admit that their

[page 2]
Mother Elizabeth to whom certain parts
of the Estate were given by said Will
for life is now dead.  & they further
admit that such part of said Will
as recited in said Petition are
correctly recited. & that the bequest
of negroes to be divided is in substance
truly set forth therein. -- They also
admit that Elisabeth Careathers now
Elisabeth Cabe did. upon her intermar-
=riage with John Cabe, enter into Mar-
=riage articles & that Richard Andrews
was the Trustee in said Articles & now
claims in virtue ["of" x-out] thereof the property
to which said Elisabeth was entitled
under her fathers will & that the copy
of said Article appended to the Petition
is a true copy.  That the Defendt.
John Andrews[sic] doth not admit but denies
that the allegations in said Petition in
regard to the boy Charles purchased
by said John, are true  & insists that
the truth in reference to said boy is
this, that Henry Edwards Senr. father of
Defendants sold the said Boy to Deft.
John when he was quite small & that
Deft. John gave to his said father a
very valuable young filly, supposed

[page 3]
to be worth $100 or thereabouts at that time for said boy.
that his said father sealed & delivered to Deft.
John a Bill of Sale for said boy Charles
with the sum of $200 named therein as the
consideration money which he therein ack-
=nowledged to have recd. in full - that one
Isaac Durham & Petitioners Henry Edwards
were the subscribing witnesses to said Bill of
Sale - but that there was no agreement or under
standing that there was to be $200 pd. by Deft. at
his fathers death for said boy as is falsely
alluded in the Petition. that his father came
unto the County Court at May term in 1826 & acknowledged the
execution of said Bill of Sale & it was ordered to
be registered & that was the last which Deft. has
ever seen of said Bill of Sale - that he made
repeated inquiry of the former Clk of said
County Court, but could never obtain it, being told
that some one had called & taken it out under
pretence of having it registered. - And Deft.
avers that it was a bona fide sale & so intended
by his father & himself. & that some time before
or after their said father sold to Henry the
Petition a negro called Nelson which he does
not mention in the Petition, but for which he
has always alledged[sic] that he pd. about $100 &
got a Bill of Sale for from their said father.
Deft. John further alledges that so well

[page 4]
are all the legatees satisfied that Deft. John
did purchase said boy Charles & pay for him
that they have relinquished all claim to him
to Deft. John in writing which writing is hereto
appended as part of this his answer
    Deft. Lindsey further answering says that the
boy alledged in Petition to have been received
by him & for which he is charged, was given
by their said father to him & was not considered
of sufficient value to sell at any price - that he
was a boy called Alvey who was subject to fits
& as the old man had let Henry & John each have
a boy, he gave this one to Deft. Lindsey without
naming any price or giving any Bill of Sale for
the reason above given, viz that he had first & was
as likely to turn our a charge as a source of any
profit - But in addition to this Deft. Lindsey
has received from all the other Legatees except the
Ptf. Henry a relinquishment in writing of all claim
on their part to said boy will Knowing as they do
that is was never their fathers purpose to hold
Deft. Lindsey liable for said boy in any way.
Further answering Deft. say that by the terms
of the Will the slaves are to be divided either
by lot or otherwise, ["divided" x-out] & they insist that
they shall be divided & not sold as suggested
in the Petition, as the division is not only easily
practicable, but is the right of the Legatees
under the Will - They further say that
they do not understand what is meant
by the expresses in the Petition "that there
will be nothing of consequence left for dis
                                       tribution.

same & were qualified as Exrs. thereof
in Open Court & have in pursuance

[page 2]
of the powers vested in them as Exrs. they have
possessed themselves of the said Estate having
now expired, the Petitioners have called
on the said Executors to account with
them for their Legacies & to pay over to
them the same, but they, the said Exrs.
have wholly refused to account & settle with
you Petitioners as they were required
by law to do - Your Petitioners alledge
that the principal part of said estate came
to the hands of the Deft. Henry Edwards,
the Co-Executor John having received
only a very small part thereof:-
Your Petitioners alledge that many years before
the death of said Henry Edwards Senr., as much as
12 or 14 years the Deft. Henry Edward Jr. took
into his possession a boy called Moses, the
property of said Henry Senr. & had the bene-
=fit of the labour of said boy which they
believe the Testator Henry Senr. would
have required at the hands of Henry Jr. if he
had retained his mind, but they aver
that some time after the publication
of his Will as hereinbefore stated, the said
Henry Senr. became non compos & by
the verdict of a Jury was so declared.

[page 3]
& the Deft. Henry Jr. was at this earnest request appo-
=inted by this Worshipful Court the Committee
or Guardian of said Henry Sr. & no account

of the hires of said boy Moses was every made
or at least returned by said Guardian, no so
far as your Petitioners are informed has said Henry
Jr. charged himself in his Account as Executor
with the hires of said boy - Nor hath the said
Henry Jr, rendered any account of his said
Guardianship, but upon being called on to do
so, declined saying he would settle as
wound up by the Exrs. - they further
alledge that said Guardian sold divers
articles, corn fodder &c of which he
hath stated no account or made
no return thereof to Court: Petitioners
alledge that the sale as Guardian &
Exr amounted as they are informed
to $1650, or thereabouts: - They charge that
said Henry Jr. had in his possession certain
notes on Allen Edwards & David Andrews
made payable by them to Henry Edwards
Sr. for money loaned by him & otherwise
which said Henry Jr. received to his own
use & has not accounted for. - He also
hired a negro ["man" x-out] boy to a man named
Morris for several months, whose hire

[page 4]
must have amounted to $18 or $20 - He also
sent a woman slave whose name was
Dianna to Mrs Delilah Lloyd for
a year or more & there is no account
of either of these hires - the latter worth
$25 or more - said Henry Jr. in the life
time of the said Henry Sr. received the
proceeds of a note due by Thomas
Faucett of $79 or thereabout of
which is is no charge agst. said
Henry Jr: And in short there was
property, money &c which came into the
hand of said Henry Jr. belonging to
the Estate of the said Henry Sr. during
his Guardianship as well as since when
he was Ext. of which there cannot be
found any account & he studiously
avoids making any disclosures to
the Petitioners in regard thereto
& seems disposed to take offence
at every proposition to settle the
affairs of the Estate fairly & in
conformity to the Will of
the said Henry Sr. of which
said will a copy is hereunto
