This will contains an unusually large number of non-standard spellings, sometimes several different spellings for the same word.  Perhaps it should be read phonetically.  Most of the spelling is phonetic, but some just skips syllables entirely, etc.

About half of the words that end in "S" appear to written with a "Z".  "S" is assumed and perhaps the "Z" appearance was just a fancy way of writing.  It's also possible that it was intentional.

James D. Long renounced appointment as executor.

Estate Papers consists of 16 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Garrett, Wilson (1881)".
