Will of Samuel Thompson - 6 Jan 1813

    In the name of God amen, I Samuel Thompson, of the
County of Orange and State of North Carolina, do make and ordain
this my last Will and testament in manner and form following.

    It is my Will that all my just debts be paid as soon as the
same can be conveniently done.

    I give and bequeath unto my Son Richard Thompson, my
Boy Slave Jacob, during the life of my Son and after his
death to his son Samuel Thompson his Executors and Adminis=
=trators for ever; And I give my young grey horse and one Cow
to my said Son his Executors and Administrators forever ~~

    I give and Divise to my Daughter Nelly Barton, Wife of
John Barton, during her life, all that tract or parcel of land
Known by the name of Kennedy's place, adjoining the lands of
William Strayhorn, containing about two hundred acres; and
after her death to her son Stephen Barton his Heirs and assigns
forever: but this devise to my said Daughter and her Son
Stephen is made subject to the following conditions and restrictions,
to wit. Whereas the said John Barton and Nelly his Wife, or
one of them, or some other person in right of the said Nelly,
may perhaps set up an erroneous claim to my Slave Anne
and her children, under pretence of a verbal gift; which
claim if set up will not be founded in truth or justice, as
I have never intended to make any such gift, or to express
myself in such manner as to amount to a Gift, but merely
to please my said Daughter when in a State of deranged mind,
without passing any right or binding the property: If, therefore,
such claim should be set up, a suit or suits thereon brought, and
the said Slaves or either of them recovered thereby or the disposition
of the said Slaves hereby made, or either of them, rendered in=
=effectual by reason of such claim; the devise aforesaid of the

[page 2]

and I hereby declare the same to be, nul[l] and void; and in such case,
do hereby give and devise the said tract of land to my Wife and
other Daughters, from whom the said recovery may be made, to be
divided amongst them in proportion to the loss sustained by them res=
pectively, by reason of such claim and loss of the said Slaves, to them
their Heirs and assigns forever ~~ And I give one bed bedstead and furniture
to my said Daughter Nelly her Executors and Administrators forever ~~

    I give and bequeath my Slaves Daniel, Ben and Anne, one Horse named

hundred and eighty seven acres, also a tract of land adjoining Cain & Ray, and Ruffin,
containing about sixty two acres, to my wife Isabell and three daughters Frances,
Hannah and Phebe, to be possessed, managed, enjoyed and finally disposed of,

to be kept on the said real estate, to be and remain to the joint use and benefit
of my Wife and said daughters Frances, Hannah and Phebe, and of the survi=
vors or survivor of them, until the marriage of one of my said daughters, at
which time she and her husband shall become entitled to the separate pos=
=session and use of all the personal property bequeathed to her either separately
or jointly; and her immediate in the said real estate shall cease;
and the said real estate and the residue of the said personal property, shall

three daughters. And it is also my will that if any one or more of my said
three daughters should die, without having been married, before the death

Hannah and Phebe until the sum to each shall amount to one hundred
and fifty dollars; and if any of the said cash shall remain to be equally
divided between my said three daughters: and if I should not at my death
have a sufficient sum of money on hand to pay my debts, and advance
my said two daughters one hundred and fifty dollars each, the deficiency must

be made up out of the general residue of my estate, or personal property
willed to my wife and said three daughters jointly, It is my will that the
legacies given by the bequest be subject to the same Conditions and
limitations as the other property given them by this Will.
