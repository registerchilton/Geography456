[Estate Papers - Report to Court Feb 1821]

To the Worshipful Justices of the Court of Pleas & quarter Sessions
for Orange County: --

    The Clerk of the Court to whom the case of Mary Standford[sic]
& others against Thomas Snipes & John Newlin Executors of the
Will of Richard Stanford[sic] deceased was referred to audit & settle
The account of Receipts & disbursement of the Defendants or Exe
-cutors as aforesaid & also to divide the Slaves belonging to the
Estate & subject to division among the petitioners, hath perform
-ed that duty & begs leave to Report:

That, having called to his assistance Wilie How Esq & Rankin McKee
Esq. to value the slaves he found that there were Eight in number
whereof he finds the value to be as follows, that is to say Saloman
& Savory his wife are worth $800:; Henderson is worth $450:; Cynthia worth
$400:; David is worth $300:; Anderson is worth $200:; which I allotted to
the petitioners as follows, viz, to the Petitioners Mary Standford the
Slaves Salomon & his wife Savony; to Laurin Standford, the
Slave Henderson; to Adeline Standford, the Slave Cynthia; to
Richard Standford, the Slave David & Anderson; & to Portius
Moore as administrator of the Estate of Carolina Stanford the
Slaves Henry and Young Stephen: all at the prices aforesaid:

- I further find that these Slaves remain on hand after the
payments of the Debts of the Testator; & that the Testator gives to
the petitioner Mary for her life one third part of the residue of
his personal Estate after the payment of his debts, & specific legacies including
in her Share a Slave called Stephen, a four wheel carriage
& his Silver Spoons given to her in the will: I find the value of the said Stephen at
the death of the Testator to be $100:; also the value of the car
-raige to be $100:; & the value of the spoons to be $50:- I find
therefore the whole value of the said Slaves & other chattels
to be $2800: whereof one third part is $933 the Specific Legacy left the said Mary is
of the value of $250 & the Slaves allotted to her of the value of $500
making together the sum of $1050:, which exceeds the said sum of
$933: by the sum of $117, which she accordingly owes to the other
petitioners in the proportions following, that is to say, to the said
Adeline, the sum of $66:75, & to each of the others the sum of
$16:75; -- All which will fully appear by reference to the ac
-count hereto annexed marked A.--

[page 2]
- I beg leave further to report, that proceeding to take the said
accounts of the defendants, I called all the said parties before me
& the said Portius for himself & as guardian for the Infant petitioners
Laurin, Adeline & Richard & on behalf of Wm Standford decd accord
-ingly allotted me, or also did the Defendants: And the said defendant
Thomas Snipes (who has transacted all the business of the Estate)
rendered the account of the Receipts & disbursements of the De
-fendants for & on account of the Estate of which is hereunto an
-nexed & marked B) whereby it appears that the whole amount
of money received by the defendants (which was wholly by said Snipes)
for the proceeds of sales of personal property, debts & from all other
sources has been & is $16087.68 & the whole account of disbursements
in the payment of Debts of the Testator, Interest & charges &c on all
other accounts is $14513.47, which with the sum of $1450; here
-tofore allowed by the Court to the said Snipes for his commissi
-ons make an aggregate of credits, to which the Executors or
rather the said Snipes is entitled, amounting to the sum of
$15963.47:- which being deducted from the said sum of
$16087.68, leaves a balance in the hands of said Snipes
of $124.31 subject to distribution among the petitioners in
the proportions following, that is to say, to Mrs. Stanford, the sum
of $41.40 & to each of the other petitioners the sum of $20.70 1/4 -

- I further report, that I find the accounts aforesaid rendered
by the said Snipes to be correct & only supported by legal vouchers
or proper proof as admitted by the parties: ---

I further find that the defendants by their own admission, still hold as
Executors Forty Shares of Stock of the State Bank of North
-Carolina, & also one share & one fourth a share of the Stock of the Cape Fear Navigation Company subject to distribution among the petitioners: And also
that   there is Stil[l] uncollected a Debt owing to them by Caleb
Lindsay on a Bond for about $300:; The same is now in
suit in the Superior Court of Law & Court of Equity for Chat
-ham County: And also that there is a demand on the
Estate of the last Colo. ________ Goodwyn of Dinwiddie County
in Virginia for about $100:- These debts are doubtful; but
if they should be collected, the proceeds will be a further fund
for distribution according to the future order of the Court:

I further report that the Testator by his Will gives out of the
Residue of his personal Estate to such Child or Children of
his daughter Mary Mebane Stith as shall attain full age

[page 3]
(if any such there be) an amount in money equal in value to his
negro Slave Jonathan & a negro wench & child to be divided among
them so arriving of full age share & share alike; & in default
such Child or Children, then the said sum of Money to fall to &
belong to the Testator's daughter Ariana:- I further report, that the
said Mary M Stith is now married to Andrus Stith & hath issue
now living ______ Children & that there is every probability
that her Child or Children will arrive to the age of 21 years; and
that therefore it is proper that the Executors should retain
some property or fund of such value as will amply secure
the payment of the said Legacy to the Children of said Mary M
Stith or Ariana Graves as the case may be:- I further re
-port the value of the said Slaves Jonathan, negro wench &
child, as the same has been computed by the Executors
& admitted in the petition & as I supposed reasonable, to be one
Thousand Dollars; and Report[?] that the said Cape-Fear Navi
gation Stock & thirteen Shares of the said Bank Stock is & will
be a reasonable & sufficient security for the costs of the
said Suit with Caleb Lindsay & for the said Legacy to the
Children of said Mary Mebane Stith or the said Ariana:

Wherefore it appears, that 27 shares of the Bank Stock can
now be distributed among the petitioners, that is to say, to Mary
Stanford, nine shares & to the petition Laurin, Adeline,
Richard & Portius as adminor., the other Eighteen shares ~~~

        All Which is respectfully Submitted. ~~~~
