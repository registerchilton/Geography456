Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume D, pages 203-204
Recorded Nov 1807

Names of executors are indistinct.  "Holt" could be "Hale", "Scott" could be "Holt" or "Hale".   It seems like Isaac is the person who signed the will and also signed the inventory in the estate papers.  The will book copy of the will clearly has "John Scott" and "Isaac Holt", and leaves off the last signature from the loose will, and the statement when the will was proven has the name of the executor as "Isaac Hoth"...  It appears that it should be Isaac Holt (will dated 5 Dec 1820)

Note: Previous indexers have interpreted the Will Book copy with the surname "Liner".  This is clearly incorrect.

Estate papers comprise six pages and are found in a folder labeled "Linn, John (1807)".  This an inventory, 12 Mar 1807.  No family history found.
