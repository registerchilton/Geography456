Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume G, pages 56-57
Recorded Aug 1854

The loose will clearly reads "Edmond Horner" and the will book copy reads "Edward Horner"

Estate papers comprise 15 pages and are found in folder labeled "Ferrel, Martha & Allen (1878)". Based on the will, the estate sale didn't occur until after the decease of Martha, Allen's wife in about 1876.  No family history found.
