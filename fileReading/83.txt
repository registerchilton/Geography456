Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume B, pages 279-281
Recorded Nov 1795

Note 1: "bequath".  The first time this is written is looks like "bequath", however subsequent versions of this word have a "z".

Generally the spellings of the will book version of the will are an improvement over the loose will spellings, however, in this specific case, many of the non-standard spellings were preserved by the person who copied the loose will into the will book.

No estate papers found.
