Recorded Feb 1832

Estate Papers comprise 15 pages and are found in a folder labeled "James, Thomas (1832)". King Barbee was appointed administrator in Nov 1832. Testator's widow later married Willie Cain.  William N. Pratt was appointed guardian of Zachariah, Nelson and James, "only children of Thomas James".  The widow dissented from the will, and petitioned for a one-fourth part of the estate, thus the slave mentioned in the will (negro Girl Mily) became property of the estate, and was ordered to be sold.  The details of the transaction are not found in the papers.

There is an additional folder, undated, labeled "James, Thomas" that pertains to this estate.  It is comprised of three pages.  No additional family history found.
