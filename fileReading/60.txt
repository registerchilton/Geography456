The writer of the original will was not consistent in their spelling, as was common practice in 1826.  This transcript is inconsistent as well.  "wheel" was usually written using the modern spelling, but sometimes "wheal" as noted.  "Mare" also appears as "Mair" as noted. "Household" appears as "House Hold", "Houshold" and "Household". Sometimes written "Dollar", usually written "Dallar", but so frequently the latter and also with so many occurrences the variants are all ignored and represented with the modern spelling.

Another unusual feature of this will is that it includes a detailed list of previous bequests and their values.

Estate papers comprise six pages and are found in a folder labeled "Coble, David (1828)"
