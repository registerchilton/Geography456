We the undersigned Commissioners
In pursuance to an order of the worship
:full the County Court of Pleas and
Quarter Sessions for the County of Orange
proceeded to value and apportion
the negroes belonging to the estate of
David Crag late of said County, among
the Several Heirs of him the said
David, towit Polly Crag, Sarah
Craig Elizabeth Craig and Alexander
Russell administrator of John Craig
dec'd. one of the Children of the said

their value Do distribute and
divide them among the several
Heirs in the following manner
that is to say To Polly Craig By ballot
we assign & give the negro Boy

as administrator of John deceased,
we allot in the same manner
Sarah and Clary: -- To Sarah
Craig we assign Hester: and to
Elizabeth Craig we give or assign
a Girl of the name of Dilcey
                       It\

    It was not possible for the
Commissioners having due regard to
the relative value of the negroes, to
divide them equally among the Several
Heirs.  Hence with a view of doing
equal justice among them they sai
and award that Polly ["Russell" x-out]

Russell administrator as aforesaid
each the sum of twelve and
an half Dollars == By doing so
