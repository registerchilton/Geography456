In the signature, the surname and seal are merged, resulting in a ink blob.

As shown above, the spelling and usage is non-standard.  Unlike most such examples, these are not corrected very much in the will book copy, although capitalization of names is added.  One notable exception is that "marey" is changed to "Mary"

No estate papers found.
