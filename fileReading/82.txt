estate.  I also direct that a fair valuation or appr-
=aisement be made by three judicious neighbors of
all my said estate, one to be chosen by each of
them in case that they themselves cannot agree
to divide the same themselves, and after being signed
by each of said appraisors that a copy of the
same be be[sic] given to my executor. I also direct that
