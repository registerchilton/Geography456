Estate papers comprise 16 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Patton, Andrew (1818)".  These seem incomplete, and occured some 28 years after the will was proved.  This contains the records of the administrators (John Thompson and Archibald Hamilton) appointed after James Hughes and Joseph Thompson served as Executors.

Note 1: De bonis non administratis, Latin for "of goods not administered," is a legal term for assets remaining in an estate after the death or removal of the estate administrator.
