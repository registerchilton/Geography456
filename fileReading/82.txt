Additional Comments:

Pationes Cotton -> Patience Cotton

This will may have been attached to some local (Orange County) legal proceedings, but doesn't seem to have been probated in Orange County (rather Northampton County, VA, as it indicates), so it is not recorded in the will books of the county.

Uses thorn character the form many of the "the" words, transcribed here as "ye"

No estate papers found in Orange County.
