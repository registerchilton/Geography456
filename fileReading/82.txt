Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume G, page 202
Recorded May 1858

No estate papers found. There are 112 pages of Estate Papers found in a folder labeled "Pope, Thomas (1864)".  In these papers, this Thomas Pope died in 1864 in Orange County, and his widow is Susan Pope.  It appears the Sarah Sabina Pope is the only heir when this estate is settled, and none of this matches the above will.
