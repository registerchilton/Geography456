Additional Comments:
Not recorded in any will books

This will is very faded and difficult to read.  This transcription assumes modern spellings, unless a different spelling was clearly used.

Estate Papers comprise 40 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Nail, Martha (1808)".  Daniel Cloud was appointed administrator 1 Mar 1804 Levi Whitted was later appointed administrator of this estate.

Daniel Cloud married Ann/Anne Mooney in 1771.

From the estate papers it appears that Sally was not set free, but continued to be treated as property.

This is a paper attempting to free a slave, not a will, though
it is endorsed on the back "Martha. Nial's will". The spelling
is confusing, in the body of the instrument it is spelled Nail,
the signature is MARTHA x NIAL, the paper is indexed in the Archives as NEIL Z
"I, Martha Nail, widow of Robert Nail late of Orange County,
N.C. "frees her slave Lucy and her issue" if the law allows
it" her son-in-law is to attempt to handle the matter if
the instrument itself is not sufficient. Lucy is to be no part
of her estate in any future will she (Martha) makes.
son-in-law: Daniel Cloud.
Witnesses: Jonathan Lindly Thomas Lindly
signed: Martha x Nial
Dated 29 (month not clear) 1797, date of probate not shown.
