Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume C, pages 98-99
Recorded May 1797

There is a Deed of Gift, transcribed below, found in Will Book Volume A, page 310

A Quit Claim Deed is found in Will Book Volume A, page 315 from Hardy Morgan to Sarah Morgan.  No family history found.

Estate Papers comprise seven pages and are found in a folder labeled "Morgan, Hardy (1796)". Widow of the testator died in 1827, which seems to have been the impetus for the sale of the slaves.
