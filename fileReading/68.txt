This will centers around the emancipation of Peter.  The widow Angel Robbs and daughter Sophia Robbs wee not provided for and prompted a "dissent" to the will.  Further the Executor, Sophia's husband Benjamin Cantrill did not settle the Estate in a manner that the widow found agreeable, all of which resulted in additional pages of estate papers.  From the papers it is not clear that Peter was actually emancipated.

Estate Papers comprise 38 pages and are found in folder labeled "Robbs, Alexander (1812)".  Widow's name is Angel Robbs
