Recorded Nov 1830

There are two handwritten copies in the folder of loose wills labeled "RAY, Peter L. 1830".  One is the original. The second one is labeled "Coppied from Jeremiah Holts coppy"

Estate Papers comprise 59 pages and are found in the folder labeled "Ray, Peter L (1832)".  Several of the pages assert that the testator died some time in 1831.  With the will written 30 Aug 1830 and proved in Nov 1830, it seems more likely that the testator died in late 1830
