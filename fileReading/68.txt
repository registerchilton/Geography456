[Estate Papers - Answer Nov 1846]
State of North Carolina } Court of Pleas & Quarter Sessions
   Orange County        } November Term 1846

    The Answer of Jacob Niece to the Petition of Sally
Albright, Jordan C Holt, William Albright, Daniel
Graves & Polly Noah - The Defendant answering for
himself only, saith that he admits that his Testator George
Niece died in the year 1840, having first made & published
his last will & Testament and that the copy thereof annexed
to the Petition of said Petitioners is a true copy thereof:
The Defendant Jacob Niece also admits that said
will was admitted to Probate at August Term 1840 & that he
took upon himself the burthen of executing said will.  He also
admits that his Testator bequeathed to his widow Mary Niece
during her natural life a negro Boy called Jerry & a
negro Girl called Jenney with various articles of personal
property and at the death of said Mary the negroes & their
increase & all the other property which should be remain=
ing after the death of said Mary Niece, was to be sold & divid=
ed among the children of the Testator George Niece. This Def=
endant also admits that the Petitioners Sally Albright &
Polly Noah are the children of his Testator & that Sampson
Niece, George Niece, Anne Nice, the wife of Joseph
Niece and this defendant are the only other children of
said Testator - He also admits that Mary Niece the
widow of the Testator died sometime in the fall of 1844, as
he understand & believes --

    Further answering this Defendant saith that after the
death of his Testator George Niece, his obedience to the directions
contained in the Will of his said Testator, he delivered to the widow
Mary the Negroes Jerry & Jenny and such articles of personal
property as were bequeathed to her Viz; Such articles of
household & kitchen furniture as she chose, The clock, Two Cows
& Calves, two head of horse, also such part of the stock of hogs

[page 2]
on hand as she might choose, the Waggon & 2 prs of Gear & the
Wheat fan And also one hundred dollars in money & one
Years provision of the crop on hand laid off as mentioned in said
Will - Further answering this Defendant saith that in or
about the month of March 1842 the said Widow Mary
was desirous of removing to the State of Tennessee - And in
order to enable her to do so, her son George, one of the Petitioners
in this Petition named ["who lived with her & managed her" x-out]
["affairs" x-out], sold all the personal property bequeathed to her
(the slaves excepted) upon a credit of nine months, after
having given the notice of twenty or more days required by
the law, as this defendant now believes - This Defendant
was then ignorant what were his rights & duties as
Executor, but he believes & now requests to your Worship-
ful Court that the property sold by the said George Niece
brought its full & fair price and as Executor of his father
George Niece's Estate be gave his assent to the sale thereof
and receive the notes & Bonds given for the property purchased
at said sale and paid the interest annually accruing
thereon to the said Widow Mary Niece or his agent
or attorney during the life time of the said Mary - The
Sales amount according to the returns made to this defendt.
by the said George Niece to the sum of $136.

    Further answering this Defendant saith, that as soon
after he qualified as Executor of the Will of the said George
Niece, he proceeded to sell, in conformity with the prov=
isions of law & the directions of the will all such property as
was not specifically bequeath and by the account of sales
returned[?] to Novr Term 1840 of Your Worshipful Court it appears
that the sales amounted to three hundred & sixty dollars &

[page 3]
twenty three cents ($360.23/100) which said sum when
collected was distributed to the next of kind according to their
right and receipts taken for the same, which
receipts he is read to show to the Court -

    Further answering, this Defendant saith that the
negro woman Jenny, mentioned in the Will of his said
Testator, had at the time of the sale, hereinafter mentioned
these children --

    Further Answering this Deft saith that in
the month of April or May 1845 he received intelligence
upon which he could rely that Mary Niece, the widow of
his Testator, was dead & that thereupon he gave the notice
required by law & sold the negroes to the highest bidder upon
a credit of 12 months - and the said negroes brought the
sum of fourteen hundred & forty seven dollars ($1447)

    Further answering this Deft saith, that
as far as he knows & believes, the Petitioner Daniel Graves
in the month of October or November 1844[?] per a bond from
one James Robertson, the life Estate of Mary Niece & the
interest in the above slaves belonging to George Niece
and Joseph Niece under a Power of attorney from
the said Mary & George & Joseph and the in pus=
uance of said purchase of the life Estate the said Graves
kept the said negroes in his possession until the sale
on the 5th day of April 1845

    Further answering this Deft saith that of the sum
of $1447 before mentioned he hath not proceeded
to collect the sum of $501 because the same was
due from the said Daniel Graves, one of the Petitioners and
the said Graves once two sixths (2/6) in the said slaves, which
will not [???] or very little the interest the said Graves hath
in this Estate - But as this Defendant is unwilling to incur the
hazard of paying any part of the money in his hands belonging
                                                       to the

[page 4]
To the Estate of his Testator to any person not entitled thereto
He pray that his Worshipful Court will upon inspection of the
Bill of Sale or Powers of Attorney mentioned in the Petition
pronounce upon the validity & he submits himself to
act under the direction & instruction of your Worshipful
Court --

    Further answering this Deft saith that he knows
nothing of the sale to Jordan Holt, of the Petitioners
by the said Sampson Niece & whether such sale was upon
good considerations & is property authenticated - Nor does
this defendant take upon himself to decide whether the
Powers of Attorney to the said William Albright from said
Jordan Holt & from the said Sally Albright are good
& valid in Law - These questions he humbly submits to
your Worshipful Court & ready & willing to abide by
and perform whatsoever this Court in its Wisdom
may think proper to instruct him to do and to pay over to
each of the next of kind or their attorney or assigns,
whatever may appear to be due to each respectively
