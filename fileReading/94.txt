Signature seems to have been written by the testator, written "Bowles", and opposed to the "Bowls" spelling elsewhere in the will.

No estate papers found.  Note that there are several folders of estate papers for the testator's  son who pre-deceased the testator are in the folder "Bowls, Thomas (1833) and Bowls, Thomas (1832)", all of which refers to accounts John W. Wilson of the guardian the grandchildren of Thomas, children of Thomas, legatees listed in the will as "four children of my Son Thomas (namely) Sarah Bowls Thomas Bowls Mary Bowls & John Bowls"
