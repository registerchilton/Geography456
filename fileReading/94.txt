Note 1: This "Phell" seems to be an attempt to start naming slaves, the
foremost amoung whom seems to be "Pheeb", mentioned later.  I have examined this closely.  I assume it was going to be Pheeb, but it says "Phell"

[page 2]
said Mansion house and 280. acres of land
belonging thereto and that your petitioners and the Defendents[sic]
being her bothers and sisters are entitled
to have her real estate divided among them
the Defendents refuse to have any division
or settlement of the estate of Nelly Latta deceased
They have as yet taken no administration
upon her estate - and the Defendants her
sisters clame[sic] all the personal as well as
the real estate belonging to said Nelly

any interest in the same

   To the end therefore that the said

    The Joint & several answer of Joseph Latta
John Latta, Elizabeth Latta, Jane Latta Arena
Latta, Amelia Latta, Rachael Latta and Fanny
Latta to the petition of George Long and Mary his
wife and John Durham and Ann his wife filed
against them in ["said Court" x-out] Orange Court of Equity

        These defendants saving and reserving &c
for answer to said petition or so much thereof as
they are advised it is material for them to an=
swer say, that they admit, that the female defendants
Elizabeth, Jane, Arena, Amelia, Rachael and Fanny
together with their sister were seized as tenants in
common in fee simple of the Homestead Tract of land
of the late Thomas Latta deceased, containing about
280 acres as charged in the petition subject to the
dower right of their mother therein, & that she is dead.

    They further admit that Ellen their sister has
died intestate and that her interest in said land
being one seventh undivided part thereof hath
by her death descended to her heirs at law, who
are these defendants, and the petitioners Mary
and Ann their sisters.

    These defendants further admit
that after the death of their sister her survi=

[page 2]
ving unmarried sisters supposed that there[sic] alive were alone entitled to her
property, until they had consulted a lawyer
upon the subject, and afterward they fully admitted
the rights of the petitioners and were ready and
willing that one seventh part of the land {"might" x-out]
["be laid of either in quality" x-out] in quality and
value might be laid of[f] and disposed of accor=
ding to laws by the voluntary act of all the parties,
without resorting to any suit for that purpose/

    But these defendant shew that this petition
has been filed against them without any notice
give to them previously of such purpose.

    These defendants submit that the plaintiffs
are not entitled in law to have their prayer in
said petition granted to them by a decree of this
court.

    And having fully answered the said petition
they pray to be hence dismissed with their costs.

                              J. W. Norwood Sol

Jane Latta one of the defendants
maketh oath that the fact stated
in this answer as of the knowledge
of the defendants are true & the       Jane Latta
rest they believe to be true.

    Sworn to before my
Sep 16th 1858 Thomas Webb C&MCE[?]

[Estate Papers - Decree Concerning Petition Sep 1858]

Geo. Long & wife
 vs
Joseph Latta & others

        This case coming on to be heard
upon the Bill and answer and the argu=
ment of counsel being heard on both
sides, it is declared by the Court that the pe=
titioners are not entitled to a decree for the
sale of the land mentioned in the petition,
by the case shewn in the pleadings:

        And it is therefore adjudged and
decreed by the Court that the petition be dis=
missed, & that the defendants do recover
against the plaintiffs their costs in this
behalf sustained to be taxed by the
Clerk & Master of this Court.
