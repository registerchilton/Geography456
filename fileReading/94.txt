Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume A, pages 259-260
Recorded Nov 1785.

Uses the archaic letter thorn once.

Estate papers comprise 72 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Debow, John (1783)".  Much of the material concerns the accounting and reporting of money spent by the children's guardian.  There are numerous mentions hiring of the slaves even after Jacob Lake and Robert Scoby bought them in 1786.  If there is a particular interest in these people, it may be best to re-examine these estate papers.  Accounts of hiring of these slaves continue at least until 1798.  Also mentioned is the hiring of "Fann and her children", indicating that perhaps Easter/Ester and Dick are Fancy's children.
