Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume E, pages 21-22
Recorded Aug 1822

Original will contains many inconsistent spellings.  The first instance of "bequeath" uses modern spelling, but is often "bequeth".  "Negro" is often "nigro".
"Give" is often written "gave".  The will book copy corrects many of these.

Line found in loose will, missing in will book copy:  "I give to my Daughter Marey/Marcy a Negro girl named Ann"

No estate papers found.
