Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume F, pages 174-175
Recorded Nov 1843

The will book version of this will is missing several names near the end of page 174, as noted.

Estate Papers comprise 110 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Blackwood, John (1843)".  This seems to be disputes in the accounting for rental income and distributing the funds to the legatees.  Additionally, the executor was accused of selling the rental property on behalf of the estate and also purchasing it for his own purposes.
