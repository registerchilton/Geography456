Recorded Nov 1853

Will undated.  Above date is the date that the administrator was appointed.

The scribe for this will does not seem to know how to spell Faucett, or a number of other words and seems to scribble a bit when unsure.  This transcription uses generous assumptions for spelling.  There are no indications for splitting the various words at the end of the lines.  Appears to use uppercase "P" when words start with this letter.  No executor named.  No date.  Probably not written by the testator, but writing resembles that of James Webb, one of the signatories.

Estate papers comprise 12 pages and are found in folder labeled "Faucett, Rebecca (1853)".

$35 to grandchildren, indicates she had seven grandchildren, unnamed in will and estate papers.

Thomas S. Faucett was appointed special Administrator 14 Sep 1853
