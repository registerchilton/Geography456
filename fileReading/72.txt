Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume E, pages 366-367
Recorded Nov 1835

The original will was filed under "Lutterlow".  Neither the loose will nor the will book version are distinct, but the first letter of the name "Lainey" is dissimilar to the first letter of the surname.  The ending letter - whether "w" or "n" - is also indistinct in the original.

This could also be Fullerton

No estate papers found under surnames that start with "Lutte" or "Tutte" or "Fullert".
