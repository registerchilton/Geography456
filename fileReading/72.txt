William Freeman died in December 1781 or 30 September 1780
Mary Dagharty named spelled Mary Doherty in papers.
granddaughter Frances McKerral married Abner Benton Bruce
Robert Freeman (son of Tabitha) married Sally, daughter of Capt William Green, April 1793, 11th or 12th.

William Freeman owned 1396 acres in Bertie County which Robert sold 8 Mar 1788, buying a plantation in Warren County of 606 acres (for $6,666) and another of 270 acres for £770 Virginia Money(2 Sep 1790).   This resulted in a net income of $1,432.66. In addition the lands in Norfolk sold for £435 Virginia Money. This family also owned land in Norfolk, Virginia, Warren County, and Orange County.

Frances Child was the wife of Francis Child?
William Freeman's son John Freeman was lost at sea and never returned.
The slave Esther is sometimes referred to as "Hester"

Many general references to slaves.  Moses mentioned by name was to be sold, per William Freeman's will.  He was sold for £90 or £100 Virginia Money (listed variously) to Jeremiah Mitchell. Around 1790, the Warren plantation employed "16 Slaves 10 of which were prime working hands."

The name of "Jubilaro" or "Jubilo" is a slave mentioned by name in the papers, purchased with the money that came from selling Moses.

"That the present [Clerk &] Master hath not charged the defendts Mother with annually a Slave
belonging to Defendt at her death; and which she gave away or disposed of in her
lifetime to Frances McKerall now the complainant Mrs Bruce, or otherwise claimed
or converted to her use; which the same Master ought to have done. ~~
    Remark there is no proof of any such gift or transfer; the girl Annaka was
    very small and died before the Testatrix; and if Defendt claims or had
    title to her; he is Indebted to Abner B. Bruce for her maintainance[sic], attendance
    in sickness & burial expenses

                               In pursuance of a Commission which is hereunto
annexed issuing from the Court of Equity for Hillsborough District directed to us
                                          two of the Justices of the Peace in and for
Orange County aforesaid and authorising us to take the Testimony of certain
persons to be read in evidence in a certain suit in said Court depending
between Mary Doherty & others Complainants & Robert Freemand[sic] defendant
--- We have cause to come before us at the house of John Faddis tavern
keeper in the Town of Hillsborough this Saturday the 7th day of August
1801- John McKerall of Orange County planter of lawful age a witness
produced on the part of the complainants, Abner B, Bruce attending on the
part of the  complainants and no one on the part of the Defendant and the said
John McKerall being duly cautioned sworn and examined touch what he
may know respecting the said controversy Deposeth and saith as follows
(Viz) that in the latter part of the year 1793 as well as he recollects his
Grand Mother Tabitha Freeman came up to Hillborough on a visit to
her Daughter France Children the mother of the Deponant[sic], and while she
remained there was in her perfect sense at all times and as well in
health as she generally was, she being an aged woman and somewhat
infirm --- that during this visit she came to a resolution of making
her will frequently complaining that her Son Robert Freeman had treated
her with harshness. that she was entitled to all the property his father
left during her life and notwithstanding this her said Son had
taken every thing into his own possession and scarcely granted her with
a reluctant hand the com[m]on necessaries of life --- And Deponant saith
having come to this resolution and being in her perfect senses and not
confined with sickness - she the said Tabitha sent this Deponant for Mr.
William Nash with a request that he would come to the said Tabitha
and draw her Will - and Deponant saith he carried said
messuage[sic] to Mr. Nash - and in consequence thereof he (Mr. Nash)

[page 2]
waited on Mrs. Freeman and as deponant has been informed and
verily believes then drew her last Will and testament, and deponant
saith that he has heard his Grandmother the said Tabitha say
before making the said Will that since she was not permit[t]ed to enjoy
her property while she lived by means of the improper conduct of her Son
she would at least take care to leave it out of his power after her
death.  Deponant further saith that previous to the time above mentioned
(towit) in or about the winter of 1791 he went to live with the said Robert
Freeman at the plantation in Warren County and deponant staid[sic]
there about three or four months, that during that time the said
Robert Freeman acted as sole master of the land house & property
consulted no body about his conduct or his management, sold
and disposed of whatever he thought proper, and not only appeared
to be the owner in fact of every thing, but seemed desirous that
every body else his mother not excepted should so consider him ---
In this time Deponant saith that the said Robert employed him
to make sale of a parcel of Hoggs at Petersburg which the said
Robert had cause to be driver there under deponants care amount=
=ing in number to between thirty and a hundred Deponant not
knowing at this time the precise number and deponant saith these
Hogs were raised on the said Warren plantation and by the Will of
William Freeman the father of the said Robert belonged as deponant
understands and believes to the said Tabitha -- Yet when the Hogs
were sold by deponant at Petersburg and he returned to Warren with
the money, the said Robert claimed and received from deponant
the whole of the money proceeding from that sale amounting to
about two hundred Dollars. and at that time deponant saith
that the said Tabitha complained of the conduct of her Son the said
Robert saying it was extremely hard that while all the pro=

[page 3]
property of her deceased husband belonged to her during her life she
could not command any part of it.  while her Son arrogated to
himself the whole ownership and disposal of it, she said also at
that time that all she had received from her Son during the time
she had resided on the warren plantation was two stuff Gowns &
money not exceeding five or Six dollars --- and deponant saith
that the said Robert paid for a tract of land which he bought in his
own right from James Johnson in Warren County in part by this
money produced by Sale of said Hogs - deponant further said
that he has heard said Robert & Tabitha in conversation together
on the subject of the property which she claimed by her late husbands
Will in which conversation the said Tabitha complained that
she did not receive what belonged to her, but that he Robert acted
as owner and absolute proprietor of the whole, to which the said
Robert answered that she lived as well as any body in the County
and therefore had no right to complain, but the said Tabitha
replied that her mere living was not the thing, she had a right
to property which was kept from her while he appeared to be owner
of every thing not she and deponant said that he knows of
his own knowledge that the said Robert did dispose of all
the property which he sold during the time Deponant lived
with him as his own and in his own name, and did not
act as if he was accountable to any one for it, particularly that
in this manner he sold and disposed of the Port above mention=
=ed, and also of Tobacco to the amount of Eight Hogsheads
or thereabouts - And deponant said that after his return from
Petersburg in care of the said drive of Hogs the said Robert told
him that in his absence he had been very industrious in

[page 4]
Manufacturing Flour at the Mill on said Warren plantation and
had sold a considerable quantity --- further deponant saith he
well knows that the said Robert made a great quantity of Brandy
from the Orchards of the plantation, and that while deponant lived
there, there was no brandy used of consumed but that which was
the product of said plantation, And deponant saith he verily
believes that no brandy was ever drank there but what was raised
on the plantation, at least if there were it must have been
without necessity -- further deponant saith that the said
Robert while deponant lived with him was fond of society
and entertained much company at great expense ----
Deponant further saith he has heard the said Robert Freeman
say he had sold landed property in Virginia belonging to his
late father during the said Tabitha's life time to the amount of
between four & five hundred pounds Virginia money or there
abouts.  And he has heard that said Tabitha say she never
received a fathing on that account -- Deponant further
saith that while he lived on said plantation, there were there the
following Slaves (Viz) Scilla, Sandy Senior, Sandy junr, Davy
Bill, Bobb, Jack, Abb & Esther all these were prime young Negroes
full grown besides these there were some children whoes[sic] names or number
Deponant does not recollect - all the property of William Freeman
as the said Robert hath frequently acknowledged to this deponant declaring
that the said Negroes were his after the death of his mother --- there
were also of the said Estate living on the said plantation at that
time the Negroes Nell and her children in number 3 or 4 (three
or four) Deponant does not recollect which - And deponant saith
the Children of Nell after the death of said Tabitha came to the
possession of Mary Doherty the complainant as he is informed
& believes, they together with their Mother Nell being left by William

[page 5]
William[sic] Freemans Will to said Mary Doherty -- Deponant further
saith that the said Robert purchased after his father[s] death and during
his mothers lifetime a Negroe man called Jubilo, and another named
Sharper, for which negroes the deponant believes the said Robert paid
out of the product of his mothers Estate, for deponant saith the truth
is that the said Robert had no property in possession at the time
of his fathers death, and what he got afterwards was as
Deponant believe his mothers by right as long as she lived.
and further this Deponant saith not.

        The Deponant being then Asked by
               the commissioners before whom this Deposition was
taken where he knew any thing relating to this Contrary on the
part of either the of Complainants or the Defendant further than what
he had declared he answered ---  Answers I do not recollect any
thing more of this matter in dispute than what I have declared
herein ~~~ ~~~

Hillsborough Superior Court of Equity in which Mary Doherty & others are
Complainants & Robert Freeman Defendant - at the Tavern of John Faddes
in the Town of Hillborough on Saturday the Seveth day of August
A.D. 1801 ------ The deponant Frances Child having been first
duly sworn on the holy Evangelists of Almighty God deposeth and
saith that sometime in the month of _____________________ in the
year one thousand Seven hundred & ninety three Mrs Tabitha Freeman
the mother of this Deponant came  to Hillsborough and after being
there for some time expressed her intention of making her last Will
and Testament, that she accordingly sent for Mr. William Nash an
Attorney at Law to draw her Will, that Mr Nash came to the house
of this Deponant where Mrs Freeman then was and after they
had had some conversation on the subject and Mr Nash
had received her instructions he commit[t]ed the Will to writing
in her Mrs Freemans presence who sat by and occasionally sug=
=gested to him what she wished to be inserted therein, and when
the Will was drawn Mrs Freeman read it over herself & then
Signed Sealed pronounced and declared the same to be her
last Will and Testament in presence of this Deponant
who together with the said William Nash at the request
of Mrs Freeman subscribed their names as witnesses thereto.---
    Deponant further States that she was continually in the
room with Mrs. Freeman & Mr Nash while the latter was writing the
said last Will and Testament and that the same was finished
and compleated[sic] in the presence of this deponant & she verily
believes that the said Mrs Freeman was at the time of giving
instructions to Mr Nash respecting the draught of her Will and
at the time of publishing & declaring the said last Will & Testament
of sound & disposing mind and memory & this Deponant is
strengthened and confirmed in this belief from the said last

[page 7]
Will and Testament being made to the purport & effect to which
Mrs Freeman oftentime before the making of it. -- assured this deponant
she intended & would make it ~~
                                 Deponant further States that she
found among the papers of her deceased Husband Mr. Francis Child
a Bond Executed by Robert Freeman to said Mrs Tabitha Freeman
for the purpose as the deponant believes of securing to said Mrs.
Tabitha Freeman an interest in a certain tract of land which
said Robert Freeman was about the purchase & did in fact purchase
with the money arising from the Sale of the plantation which was
devised to Mrs Freeman by her deceased husband lying in Bertie
County and which said Robert Freeman by consent of his mother
said Tabitha sold to the late Colo. Whitmill Hill for the Sum of Two
thousand pounds Virginia money as deponant believes ------
Deponant doth not now recollect but verily believes that the penalty
which he the said Robert Freeman by said Bond was to incur
in the event of his hot taking such a Deed from the person of
whom he purchased the lands in Warren County, as would
secure Mrs Freeman as Interest therein was at least the Sum
of five hundred pounds Virginia Currency. Deponant well
recollects the Signature of Robert Freeman to said Bond, and
that is was in the Defendant own proper hand writing ---
and that after keeping said Bond in her possession for some time
she delivered it over to Mrs Freeman since which this Deponant
hath not seen it ----

Freeman of Warren County Gentleman That Tabitha Freeman late of Warren aforsaid
deceased was in her life time possessed of and entitled to the use of an ~~~~
Estate real and personal under and by virtue of the Will of her husband
William Freeman also deceased for her natural life with a remainder ["the Complainant" x-out] your Orator and
his heirs fore ever Expectant on the death of the said Tabitha That the said
Tabitha died so possessed but some short time before her death she went
on a visit to Mary Doherty of Orange County Widow and to Frances Child of Hillsborough
in the said County widow and while she was at the said Frances Child's in
Hillsborough aforesaid being very low in health and extremely weak both in
body and mind they the said Mary Doherty and Frances Child sent ~~~~~
for William Nash Esquire an Attorney at law to draw and prepare the said ~~~~
Tabitha's Will and the said attorney accordingly attended and being furnished
with pen ink and paper took instructions from the said Mary Dougherty and
the said Frances Child for drawing the same will and the said Mary ~~~
Dougherty and Frances Child dictated to the said attorney what legacies
should be given and how and in what manner provision should be made for
their payment and according to the instructions so given by the said Mary ~~~
Dougherty and Frances Child and as they dictate, the said attorney drew and
prepared the said Will but the said Tabitha Freeman often declared her ~~~
dissent to the legacies and provisions do dictated and that her son ["the Complainant" x-out] your Orator
had behaved in the most dutiful manner towards her and that she would not
for the world do any act to his prejudice and that such legacies would ~~~
injure him That the said Tabitha never willed any ["such" x-out] of the said ~~~
legacies or provisions neither did she give any instructions for the same
nor dictated them or any of them nor were they agreeable to her mind but
the said Mary Dougherty and Frances Child by the most earnest
importunities and pressing sollicitations[sic] and by undue and improper practices made and used by them to ["the said" x-out] ~~~
and upon the said Tabitha on that occasion, at length so far overcame the said Tabitha as
to induce her, against her own will and inclination to sign the will so drawn
and prepared from the instructions and dictate of the said Mary ~~~

Dougherty and Frances Child by the attorney as aforesaid and which will is in
the words and figures or to the effect following (that is to say) " "In the name of
"God Amen I Tabitha Freeman of the State of North Carolina and Warren County
"being very low and infirm of body but of perfect mind and memory and being desirous of
"disposing of part of the profits of my late husbands Estate bequeathed to me in his
"last Will and Testament bearing date the thirtieth day of September in the year of our
"Lord One thousand Seven hundred and eighty one do make and publish this my
"last Will and testament in manner and form following (that is to say) I give
"to my daughter Mary Dougherty one hundred pounds Virginia Money to her & her

"Single and without issue then her part to go to her mother Mary Dougherty &

"for a negro man called Moses belonging to the Estate of my said husband to
"which I am entitled by the said Will & of which I have not recd. any part
"for the payment of these legacies herein bequeathed I also appropriate for the

for the taxes of property in Norfolk I do nominate and appoint Mary
"Daugherty and Frances McKeral my Executrix to carry this my Will into
"effect - Tabitha Freeman (seal) Signed sealed and deld. in the presence
"of Frances Child, W. Nash" And your orator further showeth that the ~~~
said Tabitha Freeman was at the time of her so signing the said Will very uneasy
distressed and unhappy in her mind and her Mind was at the time so ruffled
and disturbed (by the undue and improper influence exerted over her by the
said Mary Dougherty and Frances Child her daughter and by and through their pressing
sollicitations ["and" x-out] earnest and undue and improper practices then made and used to and upon her as aforesaid
importunities) as to deprive her in a great measure
of that calmness and soundness of mind which is necessary on such an occasion and ~~~
                               (2)

[page 3]

thereby so far get the better of her own will and inclination as to compel her against the
same to sign the said Will when in truth she did not want to make any will, and
would not have signed any but by and through the undue influence importunities
["and" x-out] sollicitations[sic] and improper practices of her daughters the said Mary Dougherty and Frances Child as aforesaid
That soon afterwards the said Tabitha died (to wit) on or about the 24th day of September
in the year of our Lord One thousand seven hundred and ninety ["seven" x-out] six and the said Will appears
to have been proven by the oath of the said Frances Child in Warren County ~~
Court in or about May ["term" x-out] in the ["same" x-out] following year ~~~~~~~~~~~ and Letters
Testamentary granted to the said Mary Dougherty and Abner Benton Bruce the name and addition of Abner Bruce Executor
in right of his said wife Frances who then qualified That ["the Complainant" x-out] your Orator has no
notice of any such will till after the same was proved and even then did not
know the circumstances above related with regard to the making thereof which
circumstances never came to the knowledge of the Complainant[sic] [your Orator] till on or ~~
about the twelfth day of April one thousand seven hundred and ninety eight
when the Complainant[sic] [[your Orator] conversing with the attorney who drew the said will was
informed of the circumstances accompanying the drawing [of] the same and signing
thereof as aforesaid That ["the Complainant" x-out] your Orator became entitled to the said real and
personal estate of the said William Freeman deceased after the death of the said
Tabitha (John Freeman named in the said William Freemans said Will having
been lost at sea and never returned) and well hoped he should have possessed
and enjoyed the same without any claim or demand whatsoever of the said Mary
Dougherty Abner Benton Bruce and Frances his wife and Mary Burk or any or
either of them as in justice and Equity he out to have done BUT NOW SO IT IS
may it please your honors that the said Mary Dougherty and Abner Benton Bruce and

word to charge them as Defendants and contriving how to injure and defraud your orator in the
premises they the said Mary Dougherty Abner Benton Bruce and Frances his wife
and the said Mary Burk or some or one of them set up some Claim Right or ~~
Interest in to or out of the same real and personal Estate sometimes pretending
that the said Tabitha duly made and published the said Will and that she was
of sound and disposing mind memory and understanding at the time she made
the same and that she had a desire of disposing of the profits of her then

[page 4]
late husband's Estate bequeathed in ["her" x-out] his Will or of part thereof and that the said
Will pretended to have been made by the said Tabitha
was duly drawn and prepared from instructions give by herself and that
seeveral legacies and provisions contained therein were dictated by her and
that the ["said" x-out] same writing contained her last Will and Testment WHEREAS you
["the Complainant" x-out] orator charges the contrary to be ture and that she did not duly make and
publish any will and died Intestate and that she was not of sound and disposing mind memory
and understanding at the time that it is pretended that she made the said Will
and that she had not any desire of making any disposition wha[t]soever and that she
herself though she had nothing to dispose of but that what she possessed would at
her death belong to your Orator and thus the same will was not drawn or
prepared from any instructions given by her but from instructions given by the
said Mary Dougherty and Frances Child or one of them against her will and
inclination and without her consent and without her having at the time it was so
prepared a mind to make any disposition and that the several legacies and
provisions contained in the said pretended will were not dictated by the
said Tabitha but by the said Mary Dogherty and Frances Child or one
of them without the said Tabitha's being minded or desirous to make the same
and against her consent and that the writing so signed by the said Tabitha ["purporting" x-out]
 to be her will does not contain her will but was made by and contained
the will of the said Mary Dougherty or one of them
and was drawn prepared and signed in the manner and by and thro' the undue Influence importunities sollicitations and improper [proceeds?] as to the said Tabitha's [desires?]
and your Orator further charges that the said defendants sometimes pretend that your
orator has possessed himself of some personal Estate which was of the said Tabitha's
at her death or was indebted to her at the time of her death for the hire of ~~~
some negroes and for interest of some money and otherwise And the said
Mary Dougherty and Abner Benton Bruce pretending to be Executors of the
said Tabitha have commenced an action at law against your Orator in the
Superior Court of law for Hillsborough District to recover the same - ~~~
WHEREAS your Orator never possessed himself of any personal estate whatsoever
which was of the said Tabitha at her death and your Orator did not at her
death owe her any thing in any manner whatsoever but hath paid one or ~~~
more debts of the said late William Freeman and interest which ought to
have been paid by the said Tabitha and the said Mary Burk claims some
right or interest under or by virtue of the said pretended Will of the said
Tabitha.  ALL WHICH actings doings and pretenses of the said confederates and
contrary to equity and good conscience and tend to the great injury of you

                           of Mary Dougherty Widow - and
                           Abner Benton Bruce and Frances
                           his Wife Defendants - to the
                           Bill of Complaint of Robert Freeman
                           - Complainant

These Defendants now and at all times hereafter saving
to themselves the benefit of Excepting to the defects and
untruths contained in the Bill - for answer to do much thereof
as there are advised is material to be answered - the said
Mary and Frances speaking for themselves say, it is true that
Tabitha Freeman having as the Defendants have been informed
a claim to the use of a large Estate real and personal
formerly the Estate of her deceased husband William Freeman
during her natural life with remainder Expectant to the said
Robert - when when at Hillsborough about _______ before
her death being in an infirm state of Body but in the perfect
use of her reason understanding memory and all her other
faculties of mind Express a desire to have her Will made,
chiefly as she then declared to prevent what little property she
had from falling into the hands of her son the Complainant
Robert Freeman with whom she was much displeased on
account of his undutiful behaviour to her ---  And
these Defendants admit that the said Tabitha made her
Will to the effect stated in the Bill but do each for
herself utterly and positively deny that the same was dictated
to her the said Tabitha or in any way imposed on her by
these Defendants or either of them or by the said Frances
Child mentioned in the Bill or by any other person whatever
to their knowledge or belief, but these Defendants on their
oath say the suggestion of the Complainant in his Bill to that effect

[page 2]
                         (2)
is absolutely false for with respect to ["the said Frances Child" x-out]
this Defendant Mary Dougherty

[This section originally stated: declares she (the said Frances)
was not present when the Will was drawn, nor was the Defendant
Frances Bruce - and with respect to this Defendant
Mary Dougherty she saith atho she was at that time
preset yet" mostly x-out]

[Changed to read]

she declares that she ~~~~~~~
was not present when the Will was drawn, And this Defendant
Frances Bruce saith atho she was at that time present

[Continuing on]
she did not in any manner dictate to
or impose on the understanding of the said Tabitha
in making her said Will but the same was the free
and voluntary Testament and Will of the said Tabitha
made at her own request and by her own instructions
and at a time when she was of sound disposing mind
and memory and in the full possession use and
exercise of all her faculties and not capable
of being cajoled wheedled or practised on, if
such things had ever been attempted which this
Defendant wholly denies to have been done
either by herself or any body else within her
knowledge --- And this Defendant ["Mary Dougherty" x-out] Frances Bruce
admits[?] that William Nash and Attorney of
Standing and reputation in the town of Hillsborough
was at the desire of the said Tabitha sent for to draw
the said Will and did so - a thing which this
Defendant imagines Mr. Nash for his own sake
would hardly have concerned himself with or consented
to be a party in transacting if any fraud or
imposition had been attempted in the business
- Also these Defendants Mary Dougherty and Frances
Bruce deny that the said Tabitha ever in their presence
or to their knowledge or belief declared the said Will not
to be hers, or that it was dictated to her, or that
she have never willed any of the said legacies nor
given instructions respecting the said Will, but dissent from
the same, the Contrary of all with these Defendants charge
to be true                                          Nor
                      2

[page 3]

                    3
Nor did the said Tabitha declare as charged in the
Bill that her son had behaved in the most dutiful
manner to her and that she would not for the
world do any act to his prejudice and that these
Legacies would injure him - though these Defendants
verily believe that the said Tabitha regarding the
Complainant as her only son would not willingly have
done any thing to prejudice him as to his Character
in the eyes of Strangers and the said Tabitha in fact
so Expressed herself - but she notwithstanding complained
much of the undutiful behaviour of her said son
and related to these Defendants and other of the family
many instances thereof which there Defendants forbear
to Set forth out of tenderness to the Complainant - And
the Defendant ["Mary Doherty" x-out] Frances Bruce speaking for herself saith
that the said Tabitha at the time of making her said
Will ["the said Tabitha" x-out] was not ruffled in her mind
nor in any degree disturbed by the sollicitations ~~~~~~~~~~
importunities or undue influence of her this Defendant
or of the said Frances Child as far as this Defendant
hath knowledge - and this Defendant declares the
suggestion in Complainants Bill to that effect is
untrue - but saith the said Tabitha was perfectly
calm composed and steady in all her conduct
respecting the making and publishing her said Will
which she had long had in contemplation, and for
the doing of which the behaviour of her said
son was as this Defendant believes one of her
chief reasons -- these Defendants Mary Doherty & Frances Bruce further saith that
the said Tabitha did not die for a long time after
making and publishing her said Will to wit for the
space of __________________ nor did she die in Hillsborough
nor in the presence nor under the influence of any of the
                       (3)                          parties

[page 4]

                         (4)
parties defendant to the said Bill nor any charged
therein by at ["the Complainants"] her own House where she
had resided together with the Complainant for many
years & particularly from a short time after making
her said Will till the time of her death -- Yet the
said Tabitha during all the period never revoked
the said Will, nor did any act to shew her ~~~~
disapprobation of it, but on the contrary concealed
the Circumstances of making it from the Complainant as appears by
his own shewing - though living in the house with
him and entirely in his power - And this Defendant
doth utterly deny that the said Will was drawn from
the Instructions of her this Defendant or the said
Frances Child but was absolutely drawn from this
express instructions of the said Tabitha herself *
                     And this Defendant Abner Benton
Bruce answering for himself saith that he knows nothing
of the matters complained of in the Bill of his own knowledge,
admits that he married Frances McKerall on of the Executrixes
named in the Will therein complained of -- saith he
hath heard such Will was made and verily believes
the same was made fairly by the said Tabitha without
any undue influence or practice - and at a time when
she was in full possession of all the faculties of her mind
he also saith he believes the said Tabitha resented very
much the conduct of the said Robert towards her
& wished to Exclude him from grasping all her
property and Estate, at least after decease if she could
not prevent it in her life time -- And this Defendant
saith he always understood and believed and still believes
that the Complainant behaved like a very undutiful and
unkind son to his aged Mother, though she had been very
indulgent to him -- And the reason of the Defendants belief
in this respect is that the Conduct of the said Robert towards
                                (4)                     his

[Note in the left margin of the page, written in small characters, i.e. very long lines]

* This Defendant the said Mary Doherty further saith that the said Tabitha in her lifetime ["frequently" x-out] observed to her this Defendant, that
it distressed her greatly to see one [of] her Children, meaning her son the Complainant florishing[? flushing?] away on all the estate, while her two Daughters the said Mary and the said Frances
Child has a very small share, and thus she the said Tabitha had made a Will, and told this defendant to whom the
Legacies were given and the amount of them, and for what reasons she had differed in in the amount of the Legacies, which
consideration? took place about six weeks after the date of the said Will

[Question: Why are the answers precisely the same from two different people to the
same questions?]

[Estate Papers - Order of Reference - Oct 1803]

              State of NC
     Orange County in Equity
Mary Doherty et alia Compl.
          vs
Robert Freeman Deff.

    In pursuance of an order of reference
in this case made at October Term 1803
and the subsequent order of 1811 Sept Term
1812 and the further order of Sept Term 1817
I cause the Parties to be notified to attend me
at my office in the Town of Hillsboro on the
21st Jan 1818 and being attended by Willee
P. Mangum Esq Council[sic] for the Deff I pro-
ceeded to hear and examine the testimony in
this case

    The Complainants who claim under the
Will of the late Mrs Tabitha Freeman of
Warren County exhibited their a/c proffs[sic] &c
from which I find that William Freeman
late of Bertie was in his life time seized
and possessed of a large and valuable Estate -
both real and personal and departed this
life in or about the 30th September in the
year A.D. 1781. So seized and possessed as
aforesaid having before his death made and -
published his last will and Testament in writing
and thereby gave and bequeathed to his wife
The late Mrs Tabitha Freeman late of Warren
County his whole estate both real and per
sonal during the term of her Natural
life and after her death he gave and
bequeathed the said Estate to his two sons'
John Freeman and Robert Freeman and in
case his son John who was then at sea -
should never return to his Son Robert

[page 2]
to him and his heirs forever and thereof
appoint his said Wife Tabitha Executrix
and one Nash Hinton and his son Robert
Executors and the said Tabitha cause the
said will to be duly prove in the County
Court of Bertie qualified as Executrix thereof
and possessed herself of the whole estate of her
Testator and continued and remained so pos
sessed until about the year ______________
when she was prevailed on by her son -----
Robert to relinquish her interest therein
and that she should possess and enjoy a ---
tract of land which he was about to pur
chase in Warren County and which he did
purchase; and the said Tabitha did in
pursuance of promise and agreement aforesaid
possess herself of the Said Warren plantation
_________ Negroes, Stock, farming Utensils and
every other thing necessary for farming thereon
and continue in the possession thereof un-
til the Begin[n]ing of the year 1790 when
the said Robert the present Defft
took charge and possession of the said plan
tation Negroes, stock &c-- and continued
in possession thereof ever Since

    And the said Tabitha Freeman in or
about the 15 of Feb in the year A.D.
1794 made and published her last Will
and testament in Writing and thereby
disposed of the profits of her estate then
in the Possession of the Defft and which

[page 2]
acrued for that time until her death
And in and by her said Will gave some spe
cific Legacies follows (to wit) To her daughter
Mary Doherty she gave and bequeathed £100 Vir
ginia Money equal to $333:33 1/3 And to her
grand daughter Mary W. Burk £100 Virg. Mo.
equal to $333:33 1/3 and to her grand Daugh
ter Frances McKerrel gave £200 Virg
Money equal to $666:66 2/3 and Directed
that the Said legacies should be Paid out
of the profits of her estate then in possession
of the Defft and which should afterwords
accrue from that time until her death;
and thereof appointed her Daughter Mary Do
herty and her grand daughter the said Fran
ces McKerrel (now Frances Bruce) Execu
trixes to her said last Will and Testament
And the said Tabitha departed this life
in or about the Month of September 1796
And her said Will was duly proved in
Warren County Court And the Said Mary
Doherty and Abner B. Bruce in the Right of
his wife qualified as Executrix and Execu
tor and took upon themselves the Burthen
of Executrix the same

    I find that the following Negro Slaves
(to wit) Silla, Sandy Jun, Sandy Senr, Davy,
Bill, Bob, Jack, Abb, Hester, Stephen, Sam,
Nell, & Jubilow who the Defft. admits in
his answer was purchased with the money
for which Moses was sold and accepted by
his Mother in lieu of him

[page 3]
all of which were working hands and fit for
service and altho no agreement is proved that
the Defft. hired the Negroes and Rented them plan
tation of his Mother the last Mrs Tabitha
Freeman yet they were worth hire and the
plantation worth Rent The whole of which
at a fair Price would be worth ($621) six Hun
dred and twenty one Doll annually which in
seven years (Viz) from the first of Jan 1790
until the first of Jan 1797 making seven
Crop years as Happen[?] Mrs Tabitha Freeman
died in the all of 1796 would make the
sum of ($4374) four thousand three Hundred
and Seventy four Doll as may be seen more
clearly by the annexed schedule marked A

    I further find that the Defft Robert
Freeman paid and discharge a Bond given
by his father in his life time to one West
wood for the sum of £146:18.9 Virginia Cur
equal to ($489.79) four Hundred & Eighty Nine
Doll & Seventy Nine Cents And Interest thereon
a 6 pr cent pr Annum for 7 years one Month
& 20 days is equal to ($209:82 1/2) Two Hundred
and Nine Doll 82 1/2/100 Making in the ag[g]re
gate ($699.62) Six Hundred and Ninety Nine
Doll 62/100 for the support of Mrs Tabitha
Freeman & Servant two Hundred Doll pr
Annum for Seven years ins fourteen Hundred
Doll Making in the whole the Sum of two
thousand and Ninety Nine Doll 62/100 leaving
a Balance due the Executors of Mrs Tabitha
Freeman (Decd) of $2247:38

[page 4]
Two thousand two Hundred & forty seven Doll 38/100
leaving the question of Interest thereon to this
honorable Court.  Out of Which the aforesaid
legacies left by the Will of the sd Tabitha
Freeman (decd) are to be Paid as follows (Viz)
To the Complainant Mary Doherty $333:33 1/2
To Mary W. Burke $333:33 1/2 To Abner
B. Bruce in Right of his Wife Frances the
sum of $555:55 2/3 all of which legacies
are to bear Interest from and after the first
