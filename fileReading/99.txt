Additional Comments:
This will was not probated, and John Ellis was determined to have died intestate, and Asahel Moore was made his administrator

Widow was Mima Ellis, also written as: Jimima, Mymy, Jamama, Jamima, hence her given name was likely Jemima Ellis.  Other records assert that her maiden name was Jemima Lane

Mima died in 1821, and Asahel Moore was made her administrator, also

Estate Papers comprise about 110 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Ellis, John (1819)".  No slaves were found in these papers.
