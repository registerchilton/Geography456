Recorded Nov 1826

Handwriting of original loose will is includes unusual usage, words completely left out and creative spellings resulting in a number of possible interpretations of the various words and even name spellings.  The writer has overlooked some of the basics, such has identifying the Testator...

One interpretation of the Will Book copy renders the date of this will as 13 Sep 1825, however on inspection it appears to be 30 Sep 1825, matching the original, loose will.
