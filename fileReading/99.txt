Will of Edward Pendergrass - 10 Sep 1857

In the name of God, Amen

    I Edward Pendergrass of the County of Orange
and State of North Carolina having in view
the great uncertainty of life do make this to be
the last will and testament with regard to the
small worldly possessions which I shall leave
behind me.

    To my grandson George, the son of
my daughter Polly, in consideration of his
kindness in attending upon me in my walks,
I leave two acre[s] of land, to be laid off in a
square form around the house which his mother
has had built upon my land - the house to be
in the center of the square.

    All the rest of my property I leave to my
daughter Jane.  I do this because Jane has lived
with me, and labored hard to support me for
many years.  My other children will bear witness
to this and will no doubt approve of this disposition
of which I shall leave. There would be very little
indeed to divide out among them all, and I do
not doubt but that as I am in a manner obliged
to make a choice among them they will all
justify me in making this small provision

for their sister, who has given so many of the
best years of her life to the support of her aged
and infirm parents.

tember 1857

Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume G, pages 240-241
Recorded Aug 1860

On the loose will, the date of signing is "18th of September 1857".  The will book copy renders this as "8th of September 1857".  The body of the will states that it was written on the 10th, so the will book copy appears to be incorrect.

No estate papers found.
