Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume E, page 125
Recorded Nov 1826

Note that the will book copy seems to overlook the fact that the loose will clearly lists the testator as senior.

Signature appears more like "Cable", but other names "Coble"
Uses what appears to be a left parentheses to start new sections of the will without corresponding right parentheses.

Estate Papers found in two folders, for Henry Coble.  The folder labeled "Coble, Henry (1826)" contains the inventory with sale amounts and purchaser names by Peter Coble, executor.  This matches the above will.  The folder labeled "Coble, Henry" contains a detailed account of notes, estate sale by Allen Eulis the administrator, administrator's bond and Petition to allot dower, and also has Samuel Coble as administrator, appointed in Nov 1846, so perhaps this is a different Henry Coble.
