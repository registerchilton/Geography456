Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume G, pages 49-51
Recorded May 1854

D. N. Fowler seems to have written this, and also the will of William Leigh (1841).  Many of the letter "o" appear to be "a", and this is possibly due to dialect and phonetic spellings?

The clerk who transcribed this will into the will book preserved many of the non-standard spellings, many marked with underlines.  This is not common practice.

No estate papers found.
