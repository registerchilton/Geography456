Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume G, page 1
Recorded Nov 1851

This testator was the wife of David Mebane (will 1842), but few of his children are mentioned.  Assuming not all of his children are her children, perhaps David was married more than once?

Estate Papers comprise six pages and are found in a folder labeled "Mebane, Elizabeth (1851)".  No family history found.
