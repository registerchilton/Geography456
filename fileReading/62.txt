Many of the instances of the word "and" were written as "an" in the loose will.  The loose will skips many words, and the will book copy compensates for this by frequently adding in the missing words and minor changes of phrasing.

In the witness signature area, it appears in the loose will that it is trying to represent only one person, Susanna Durham.  Her mark is not distinct.  The name is written twice perhaps representing two individuals, or a repeat of the name to make it more legible.

Estate Papers comprise seven pages, and are found in a folder labeled "Cate, Thomas (1813)"  Includes a Bill of Sale from Thomas R. Cate to John S. Cate.
