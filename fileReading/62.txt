Estate Papers comprise 62 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Smith, Sidney S (1867)".  Despite the fact that this estate was settled after Emancipation, there are outstanding debts relating to slaves prior to Emancipation.  Slaves were hired out for the year of 1861 to Richard Blacknall, Thomas B. Morris and John W. Carr. Slave named Stephen was returned.  The slave Harriett was pregnant at the time of hire.  Dupper was "diseased and sick most of the year"
