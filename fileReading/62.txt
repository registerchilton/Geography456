        To the Honorable the Judge of the Court of Equity for Orange
        County

                      The Bill of Complaint of Rachael Armstrong
                      Against John Lancaster and Margaret his Wife
                      Stephen Glass and Betsey his wife & Mary Smart -

Humbly complaining sheweth Unto your Hounour your Oratrix Rachael
Armstrong of Orange County, that John Armstrong late of said County did
many years ago having previously published in Writing his last Will, which
after his death was duly proved, the same being executed in Such way as to
pass his real as well as his personal estates.  that the said John Armstrong
left a Widow, since dead, and five Children to wit Mary Smart, William, since
deceased, Your Oratrix, Margaret since intermarried with John Lancaster &
Elizabeth, Since intermarried with Stephen Glass -. That in and by the said
Will, the Testator devised the Use & Profits of all his land to his Widow
during her Widowhood, and then devised to his Son William the Tract of
Land containing two hundred Acres, whereon he the Testator lived, bounded by
Haw River, the lines of John Holmes, Moses Crawford & Richard Christmas:
aand to his Daughter Elizabeth, he devised his lower plantation containing
one hundred Acres, and bounded by Haw River, the Lines of Richard Christmas
Thomas Trousdale & Robert Hunter -- : And after giving certain pecuniary
Legacies to two of his Children, he "willed and bequeathed to your
" Oratrix what would maintain her out of two plantations aforesaid;
" two thirds of her Maintenance to come out of the Land devised to his Son
" William, and the other third out of the land devised to his Daughter Elizabeth
                                                                      ( to be

" to be found her Annually during her life.": But for greater Certainty
Your Oratrix prays to reference to the said Will, now of record in Orange County
Court --.

            She further shews that William one of the aforesaid
Devisees died many years ago an Infant and without Issue, and
Your Oratrix and hers Sister aforesaid, Mary, Margaret and Elizabeth are
his Heirs at Law, and the Tract of Land of two hundred Acres devised to
the said William was divided Among them after his Death.

            She Shews that by an Affliction of Providence She is
disabled and deformed, and on that Account her Father charged her
Maintenance upon the Lands Aforesaid; but that by Strict economy &
steady Industry, She succeeded many year in maintaining herself, and
imposed no Burthen upon her Sisters.  Of late years, Age being added to her
unfortunate Condition, She hath become unable to maintain herself and
hath repeatedly called upon the said Mary Smart, John Lancaster and Stephen Glass to
provide for her a comfortable Maintenance, and in Particular hath
requested them to furnish her with Suitable Diet and Clothing and to provide
for a Servant to take Care of her, get her Tin? Word?, cook & wash for her & to
do other necessary Offices about her House, she being willing to Sustain a
reasonable portion of all Such Charges, by Reason of the Land which descended
when as one of the Heirs of the Said William Armstrong Decd. : And she hoped
that they would not only provide for her future comfort & Support, but also
pay her her a reasonable Sum for the Years preceding, during which they
were bound to maintain her, her Maintenance for those Years being a
Debt which they owed to her: But they have refused to comply with this
request, and pretend that the Lands aforesaid are not charged with her
Maintenance : All with Actings and Doing are contrary to good
