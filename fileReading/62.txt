                            Your Petitioners now further shew that over and
beside the property herein before mentioned as having been sold by the
said John Carrington and also over and besides the amount of the

the said John Carrington hath since received together with the Interest

John Carrington has received in virtue of his said Administration
the sum of Fifty pounds or thereabouts from Matthew McCawley,
and also the sum of £11.19.7 or thereabouts from one John Mise

                Your Petitioners further shew that the said John
Carrington hath hitherto wholly refused to settle or account with
them for or to pay them their respective shares of the said Intestate's Estate
sometimes pretending and giving out in speeches that he has received
                                                                nothing

[page 2]
nothing in his capacity as Administrator aforesaid, Whereas in truth and
in fact he has in that capacity received the several larg[e] and considerable
sums herein before set forth, together with others which your Petitioners
are not able to specify by reason of the concealment of the said John
in that regard. -- At other times admitting that he has received large
sums of money and other property of great value in said capacity of
Administrator, but pretending that the said Arthur Mangum died
greatly involved in debt, and that the said Money and property so
received by him the said John Carrington as Administrator aforesaid
has been paid and disposed of in discharge of said debts, Whereas in
in truth and in fact the said Arthur Mangum at the time of his death
owed no debts whatso[e]ver, or if he did owe any they wee Extremely
small and trifling in value. -- At other times the said John Carrington
will admit that he has received large sums of money as Administrator
aforesaid, but pretend that the said Arthur Mangum at the time
of his decease was indebted to him the said John to the amount or
more than the amount of the sums he has received as Administrator
and that he therefore has a right to retain the property come to
his hands as Administrator in discharge of the debt so due him by
the said Intestate - Whereas in truth and in fact the said John instead
of being a Creditor of the said Arthur Mangum at the time of his
death, was at that time largely indebted to him - for your
Petitioners alledge that some time before the death of the said
Arthur Mangum to wit in March 1788 a settlement took place
between the said Arthur and the said John - when it appeared by
the accounts of both parties that he said Arthur was indebted to the
said John in the sum of Twenty seven pounds for which the said
Arthur gave his bond to the said John, and at or about the same
time the said John bought a horse of the said Arthur at the price
of Fifty dollars, and it was agreed at the time of the said
settlement that the Debt of Fifty dollars due by the said John to
the said Arthur for the horse should stand against the Debt of
Twenty seven pounds due by the said Arthur by his Bond to the said
John, and that the said Bond should not thereafter bear Interest
that the said parties were then entirely clear and discharged each for
the other. --- And your Petitioners further shew that since the
                                                             Said

[page 3]
Said settlement and before the death of the Said Arthur - the said
John became indebted to the said Arthur for the sum of £17.0.6
but to him the said John at Granville Court in May 1788 - And also
in the further sum of £27 or thereabouts it being the value of a
Tarbrough inspected Tobacco Note for 1200 lbs of Tobacco lent the
said John by the said Arthur in January or February 1789, which said
Tobacco was then worth and sold for 45/per hundred weight.
Also for the further sum of £42.10.-- paid by one William Roberts
to the said John for and on behalf of the said Arthur in June 1789
or thereabouts -- Also for the further sum of £18.6.7 or thereabouts
it being the value of 1222 lbs of parcelled Tobacco of 30/ /Cwt
delivered by the said Arthur to one John Knight at the special
instance and request of the said John. ---

                    And because it may be alledged by the said
John Carrington that the said Arthur Mangum after the settlement
of March 1788 and before his death contracted other debts with
the said John (the contrary of which your Petitioners aver to be
true / - Your Petitioners pray that the said John Carrington may
be compelled by the process of this Worshipful Court to produce his Books at the next succeeding Term
before this Worshipful Court or such persons as they may appoint for
that purpose in order that the same may be inspected and Examined
as far as related to the transactions and dealing of the said
John Carrington with the said Arthur Mangum deceased or any
of your Petitioners

                    And your Petitioners pray that the said John
may be compelled by the process of this Court full true and
perfect answer to make on his corporal oath to all and singular
the matters and things herein contained in as full and ample a
manner as if they were here again repeated and put by
interrogatories - and further that he may on his said oath fully
fairly & clearly account with your Petitioners for and about all his
transactions and dealing of whatsoever nature with the said
Arthur Mangum in his life time, and as his Administrator since his
death - and that he may pay over to your Petitioners and each of
them their respective shares of the said Estate as the Worshipful Court
shall decree and direct - And whereas by Some or one of the
                                                            Acts
[page 4]
Acts of the General Assembly of this State it is enacted among other
things to the foll'g effect that all Administrators shall settle with such persons as are
entitled to distributive shares of Intestates Estates within two years
after they shall have obtained their letters of Administration - and
whereas several to wit three years have passed since the said
John Carrington obtained his said letters of Administration over and
besides the said two years allowed him to settle by the Act of
the General Assembly as aforesaid ---

                                      Your Petitioners therefore pray
that this Worshipful Court will decree the said John Carrington to
pay such damages and Interest on the sum due your Petitioners by
the said John Carrington at the time he was by law bound to ----------
settle with them, as the Court shall think meet for the -----------
detention aforesaid.    And your Petitioners pray that the Court
will grant them such other and further relief as they in their
discretion shall think fit. -------
