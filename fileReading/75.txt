Roane County, Tennessee, Will Book Volume A, page 188
Recorded Apr 1823 (Roane County)

Not found in Orange County wills.

There is another Jan 1823 Will for a Frances[sic] Child with a son named
Samuel.  Same person?  I don't really know.

Estate Papers comprise 385 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Child, Francis (1793)". There were several estates being settled in the area for people known as Frances or Francis Child at about the 1790-1830 time period. It appears that all of the estate papers were placed in this folder

One tranche of these papers is dated Aug 1792 - 1811 and executed by Frances Child, widow and executrix of Francis Child, the testator above.  The inventory was taken 27 Aug 1792, but did not include slaves.

Another tranche is dated 1824-1827 Administered by James Grant.  It appears that Samuel Child was named Executor, and then James Grant appointed administrator  25 November 1824 after securing a bond of $20,000.
Inventory transcribed below, returned Nov 1824.

For further research into this lineage, it may be best to look in the records of Roane County, Tennessee.
