             Orange County February Term 1840
The Execution of the foregoing last Will and Testament
of Jesse Miller deced. was duly proved in Open Court
by the Oath of Alves Nichols one of the subscribing witnesses
there[to] and ordered to be recorded ~~~
At the same time Henry Whitten the Executor[sic] therein
named appeared in Open Court and qualified accordingly
                           Test

Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume F, pages 46-47
Recorded Feb 1840

Will book date near the end of the will was mis-read from the original and inconsistent with the date of probate - per the will book version the date was 16 Jul 1840, but the will was proved in Feb 1840.  A careful reading of the original indicates that it was 16 Feb 1840.

Will appoints Henry Whitted as "administrator".  The Court correctly asserts that his role is "Executor".

Estate Papers comprise 50 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Miller, Jesse (1840)".  Many lots of wheat sold.  Perhaps he was a miller?.  Heirs mentioned, perhaps the five unnamed children from the will: Sanders Miller, Minie Miller, Jefferson Mill, Mary Ann Miller, Rachael Miller.  Together with Jesse Miller (named in the will) they are described as "minors under the age of 21 years" in Feb 1843. James Jackson, Jr. is listed their guardian, as is Edmund Strudwick who entered into bond on 1 Mar 1849 for $200 to serve as guardian.  It appears that Jackson is referred to as "James Jackson (Slick)" and another person by the same named is referred to as "James Jackson (Stiller)".  Hire of the three (Anderson, Quam and Peter) for 1842 was $39.00.  For 1843 it was $78.00.  For 1844 it was $89.00.  For 1845 it was $87.00.  For 1846 it was $82.50
