Recorded May 1837

No estate papers found.  The closest match is the folder labeled "Roberts, William (1841)", however Delia Roberts is the widow to that estate, and her petition for allotment of dower asserts that her husband died after the court session which preceded the Feb 1841 session, so between Nov 1840 and Feb 1841
