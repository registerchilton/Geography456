Estate papers comprise nine pages and are found in a folder labeled "Johnston, John (1818)".  Testator's wife's name written as Isabella.  Seems to have been erroneously named "Isabella Allen" in the Administrator's bond.

The inventory of the estate of Nancy Russel, wife of James H Russel is mixed into this folder.  Nancy's inventory lists "1 Negro girl Nell aged 7 years"
