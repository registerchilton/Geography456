Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume E, pages 308-309
Recorded Nov 1833

Will book version does not have "his mark" on the testator's signature.  The loose will includes this.

Estate Papers comprise 10 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Capps, Cason (1833)".  Inventory, taken 22 Nov 1833 lists "to nigor Boy", which appears to be the "Harry" named in the will. There is an undated ledger listing that Harry sold for $750, but it does not specify to whom he was sold.
