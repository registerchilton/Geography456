[Estate Papers Affidavit 03]
Washington City
Janr. 27th 1851
    Being called on , to bear testimony
on behalf of Hugh Currie, in a collateral
issue, arising out of an attachment at the
instance of Thomas Brewer vs Alley Petty
in the Court of Pleas & Quarter Sessions for
Orange County, I state -
                    that during the week[?], of
the Superior Court, of Orange County, at
September term 1849, I was employed, by
Hugh Currie, to cause an order, of the
County Court appoint a Guardian for him,
on the ground, that he was non compos
mentis to be rescinded - Mr Allen Petty
was allege to have been, the mover of the
proceeding in the County Court, to obtain the
order in question and Mr Thomas Brewer,
who was verily[?] connected with him, by
marriage, and been appointed the Guardian
of Mr Currie - The old gentleman Mr C.
desired to set aside the whole proceeding
                                   on

[Estate Papers Affidavit 04]

on the ground of surfrige[?], and its ex
parte nature; and if this should fail,
he wished some other person appointed
Guardian -
        The subject was moved[?] in Court
upon affidavits, I think on Monday of
the term, and adjournment over untill
the next day - In the mean time it was
agreed that Mr Brewer should relinquish
the Guardianship under the order aforesaid,
and have his bond cancelled. But that
the verdict of the Jury finding the
incapacity of Mr Currie should remain -
This agreement partially reconciled the
parties, but Mr Currie had lost confidence
in Mr Petty, and evinced great anxiety
lest the latter should attempt to claim
two negro slaves, which he Mr Currie
had then in possession - He alleged, that
these slaves, had been received by Petty in
Tennessee several years before, as the property
of him Currie.  That he had sent Petty
to that state with a power of attorney
                                  to

[Estate Papers Affidavit 05]
[to] settle some business, I don't recollect what
that in the settlement, the negroes were
taken in payment of a demand due to him
Currie - but that the Bills of Sale were
taken by Petty in his own name - That
Petty did not pay or pretend to have paid
any thing of his own, for the negroes, but
on the contrary he brought them to him,
and delivered them up, on arriving from
Tennessee as his Curries property - That he had had
possession of them as his own, ever after ["for several" x-out]
["years" x-out], perhaps seven or eight years without
any dispute of his title by Petty or any one
else - But he had understood & feared, that
Petty would attempt to set up title in him-
self under the Bills of Sale aforesaid - And
he was anxious that I should take steps for
his security against such an attempt - And
I promised to institute a suit in Equity to
compel Petty to make title.
On the Saturday evening of the Court, after
the truce between the parties, as above stated
I met Mr Petty near Mr Mickles
                        store house

[Estate Papers Affidavit 06]
store house, and told him, I was glad
he & Mr Currie had settled their
difference - it was an unpleasant family
feud - He expressed[?] his satisfaction, and
said he had heard that I was about
to file a Bill against him about the
two negroes, brought from Tennessee as above
stated - I replied in the affirmative - He
said it was unnecessary.  That I might
say to the "old man" that he would
give him up the Bills of Sale whenever
he wanted them or words to that
effect - That he did not claim the negroes
I replied, that I was pleased to hear
it, and would not bring a suit -
Five or six days afterwards, I heard
that Petty had secretly left home[?]
taking away a negro woman & children, That
Mr ["Brewer" x-out] Currie had put into his possession
some years before, and with Mr C. Laws
Jr I issued a writ against him for
these latter negroes -
                       I am not aware that
I have knowledge of any other fact
touching the matter in issue between
                              these

[Estate Papers Affidavit 07]
parties - The above is true to the best of
my recollection & belief
                Signed
                   Will. A. Graham

I do not remember that I heard the
names of the two negroes received
from Tennessee as above stated - but
Mr Petty & Mr Currie spoke as if there
was no question about identity

Hugh Currie et al  }
The parties in this case have agreed to submit and do
hereby submit the same to the judgment of the court
upon the following case agreed - This is a petition
for partition - the land in controversy belonged
to old Hugh Currie and he made his will about the
 year 1851 and disposed of the land as follows to wit
"I give and devise to my son William Currie if he
"be living and returns to the County of Orange, the
"plantation on which I now live containing about 224
"acres, but if my son William Currie is dead or does
"not return to the County of Orange, I give and devise
"the said Tract of land to my grandchildren Mary
"Currie, Betsey Currie, Edith Currie, Sally Currie and
"Hugh Currie" - The said Betsey is a petitioner
and after old Hugh Currie's death married
the petitioner John Smith and Mary Currie married
and died after old Hugh Currie's death and left but
one child surviving the defendant Eliza.  Said Edith
after the death of old Hugh Currie married one
Meredith O'Daniel and they by deed and privy
examination sold their share to the defendant Hugh
the said Sally is your petitioner and the said Hugh
a defendant - The said William Currie and left
this state before old Hugh Currie's death and has
never returned to the county of Orange
but has been heard from in the state of Tennessee during the last 6 months The
above-named parties were in possession of the
land when the petition was filed - Since then the
defendant Hugh has driven all of and remain in the
possession by himself - The plaintiffs contend that
they and defendants are tenants in common
of said land under the will of old Hugh Currie

[Estate Papers Petition for Partition of Land 25]
and that a proper construction of said clause
the said William Currie must have returned within
a reasonable time to entitle him at all and that
at all events the plaintiffs and defendants are tenants
in common of a defeasible estate until his return
whereas the defendant Hugh Currie denies that by a
proper construction of said clause they are tenants in common
because that they are not tenants in common until the
said William Currie shall not return to Orange County
and until that be shown or until his death - If the Court shall be of opinion
that these parties are tenants whereupon the judgment to be entered{?] according to desire[?] of

    Humbly shewth unto your worships that Hugh Currie
late of Orange County departed this life in April last
leaving an instrument purporting to be a last
will and testament possessing in appearance all
the formal writing of a will by our law, to pass
both real and personal estate, and the same was ad=
mitted to probate in common form at the May
Term 1851 of this Court, at which time Joseph Latta
and John Latta who were named executors there=
in renounced their right, of record, to act as such
and Henry McDaniel was therefore duly appoin=
ted by the court, and qualified as administrator
of said Currie with the will annexed.  Your petitioners
show that the said Sarah Petty is a daughter of the said
Hugh Currie and as such is one of his next of
kin and heirs at law, and that he died possess=
ed of a number of slaves and other personal pro=
perty of considerable value, and seized of several
hundred acres of land.  They further expect to prove
that at the time of signing the said paper that he
was not competent for want of mental capacity

[Estate Papers - Petition Contesting Will 29]
to ["execute said" x-out] make a will,, and even if he was[sic]
capable of doing it, that he executed said paper
under the undue influence of some of the ["participate" x-out]

bled to exercise over him in consequence of the
extremely feeble state of both his body & mind, he
not having power to resist the means xxx xxxxxxx xx

Curries death and of the said probate, that they
were residing in Hem[p]sted County in the state of
Arkansas, and could not have been here in
time after hearing of Mr. Curries death, for May
Court and had no notice or summons to witness
the proceedings thereon.
        Your petitioners therefore pray your worships
that said probate may be set aside, and that said
paper writing may again be propounded[?] for pro=

further relief may be granted to them as may seem
proper to your worships in the process[?], and that the
said administrator & all other persons necessary

        the heirs of Mary Currie, James
        M. Reeves & Allen Petty
Humbly Complaining sheweth to yr. Honor
Your Orator & Oratrix of the County
of range : that at the May Term of
Orange Court of Pleas & Quarter Sessions
A.D. 1851 your Orator was by said
Court appointed Admr. with the Will
annexed of Hugh Currie deceased
late of the same County; that
among the property your Orator found
on the premises of his Testator & which
in virtue of his said appointment he
proceeded to take possession were four
slaves, towit, one of the name of Martha
& three children named ___________   ___________
& _________________; that as yr. Orator is informed
& believe the woman Martha, who is the
mother of the aforesaid children, had from
a very tender age resided on the farm
of his Testator Currie & had been claimed

[Estate Papers - Bill of Complaint 36]
used & employed as his property during all
the time they were on the farm; that some
short time prior to the death of his Testator
on Allen Petty, named among the Defendants
to this Bill, & who was a son in law of the
Testator, left the State in a sudden & unexpected
manner & as it was afterwards discovered
very deeply indebted; that soon after the
departure of said Petty, attachment
were taken out against him as an abscon-
=ding debtor; that among said attachment
were two at the instance of Charles W.
Johnston & Thomas Brewer which were
levied on the slaves named herein
& then in possession of the Testator Hugh
Currie but which the Plaintiff in said
attachments claimed to be the property
of said Allen Petty; said slaves were
thereupon replevied by the Testator Currie
& upon return of the attachments to Orange
Court, ["the" x-out] & before any trial was had
the said Currie departed this life, lea-
=ving a Will duly executed to pass both
his real & personal estate of which two
Exers. were named therein; but who renoun
=ced their right as such upon the probate of said will & Whereupon yr.
Orator at the Term of Orange County
Court heretofore mentioned was a[-
=pointed Admr. with said Will an-
nexed; that the proper issues to try the
title to said slaves were made up under
the directions of the Court [erasure]
[erasure]parties transferred to the Superior
Court of Orange; Upon the trial in which
Curt it appeared that the slaves ["had" erased]
had been purchased in the State of Tennessee
by Allen Petty & the title Deed taken in

[Estate Papers - Bill of Complaint 37]
his name, but that in fact the said Petty
had purchased the slave with the money
of the aforesaid Hugh Currie & by his di-
=rection & as his agent; that on the return
of Petty to No. Carolina he delivered
the slave[sic] to the true owner Currie
& surrendered to him also the title Deeds
or Bills of Sale which he had taken
in his own name as herein before stated
supposing as said Petty declared he did that
such delivery or surrender of the Bills
of Sale transferred the title to the slave
to the said Currie; it further appeared
on the trial aforesaid that no other
Deed was ever made to said slaves
by said Petty & that the Bills of Sale
made as aforesaid remained in the
possession of Currie up to the time
of his death & that Petty, upon being
informed some time after he left
the State & while he was here on a
visit, that his mere surrender & de-
=livery of the Deed to Currie did not
transfer the title, offered then to
make the proper legal assurance
declaring that said slave was the
property of his father in law Currie
& bought with his money, but it
was held by the Court ( as yr. Orator
is informed & believes), that the le-
=gal title having by Bills of
Sale been vested in Petty & no
subsequent Deed make by him to
Currie appearing to have divested
it, that he title was still in Petty
& that therefore the said slaves were
subject in the hands of yr. Orator to

[Estate Papers - Bill of Complaint 38]
to the levies made on them by the Pltfs
in the attachments & in obedience to
these instructions the Jury returned verdicts
in their favour; The amount of the said
claims of Johnston & Brewer together
with the costs of the whole proceedings was
($1050) One thousand & fifty Dollars & the Pltfs
has executions therefor, upon the seeing[?] out
of which, it was agreed on the part of this
Sheriff, & with consent of all interested, that
the sale might be made by or. Orator
& accordingly on the 10th day of October
A.D. 1853 yr. Orator sold at public
outcry the said slaves, at the Court
House door in the Town of Hillsboro
when they brought the sum of ($1678)
One thousand six hundred & Seventy eight doll
=ars; whereupon it was agreed that the
excess after paying off said attachment
creditors with costs, say $628 should
remain in the hands of yr. Orator
or be loaned out by him to away
the action of any claimants who
might deem themselves entitled there
=to; that accordingly yr. Orator acting
under the advise of Counsel & with
the consent of the parties interested
forthwith loaned out the said sum
taking good Bonds with security
for the forthcoming of the said amount
& interest whenever he should be
required to account therefor to the
""rightful owner"" Further complaining
yr. Orator shews to yr. Honor that the legatees
of his Testator & who, with the exception of
the said Petty, constitute the sole claimants
of the said sum in yr. Orators hands have

[Estate Papers - Bill of Complaint 41]
[Note images on FamilySearch out of order]
repeatedly demanded the same of him
alledging[sic] that they are the owners thereof
under & by virtue of the Will of
the aforesaid Hugh Currie, & have given
notice to yr. Orator not to pay over
the same to any other person; And
the said Petty having been declared in
the case trial in Orange Superior
Court as aforesaid, the legal owner of
the slaves from whose sale the fund
in yr. Orator's hands arises, he is advised that
he cannot with safety pay to the either
the Legatees or to Petty except under
the direction of this Hon; Court. In
consideration whereof & for as much as yr.
Orator is remediless in the premises
without the assistance of this Hon: Court
And to this end that the said
Defendants may interplead &
settle & adjust their respective claims
so that your Orator may under the
decree of this Hon. Court pay over
the fund in his hand to whomsoever
may be rightfully entitled thereto
My it please yr. Honot to grant to
yr. Orator the xxxx xxxx of Spa. to
be issued to Defendants to appear
be at the next term of this HonCourt
