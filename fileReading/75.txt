Estate Papers comprise 18 pages and are found in folder "Brown, James R (1854)".  Inventory was taken 12 Dec 1854.  Estate sale was held 22 Dec 1854 where  Cyrus Laws purchased "1 Boy Robert $453.00", which corresponds to the instructions in the will to "sell the boy Bob" if necessary.  Other slaves are presumed to have been transferred as the will directs.
