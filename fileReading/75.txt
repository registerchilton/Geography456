Recorded Feb 1866

No estate papers found.  There is a folder labeled "Kirkland, Elizabeth (Date missing)".  This may or may not be her.  The spelling and handwriting appear to be in a style that predates 1858, but it is simply an inventory, and there is virtually no family history found there.  William S. Kirkland was appointed Administrator which seems to indicate that the estate papers do not pertain to this proved will.
