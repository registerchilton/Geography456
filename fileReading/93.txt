Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume D, pages 16-18
Recorded Aug 1800

Seems to consistently spell "two" as "tow"
Refers to both dollars and pounds for monetary units
Note 1: This line is interlined at this point, but seems to belong just above the start of "Item 3rd"

Estate Papers comprise three pages and are found in a folder labeled "Harvey, John (1800)". No family history found.
