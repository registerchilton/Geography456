[Estate Papers - Petition to Divide and Sell Slaves Feb 1861]

State of North Carolina }
          Orange County } Febry Term 1861

        To the Justices of Orange County Court

    The petition of John C. Latta executor of Sally Latta
deceased, John Walker and Polley his wife, Tyre B. Ray &
Nancy his wife,, Elizabeth Latta, Caroline Latta, and Mary
Walker,

    Respectfully shows unto your worships that Sally
Walker[Latta] late of Orange County hath departed this life since
the last term of this Court, leaving a last will and
testament properly executed so as to pass both her real
and personal estate, which at the present term of this
Court hath been duly proved in common form
and the petitioner John C. Latta who is named as exec=
utor in said will hath qualified as such and hath
entered upon his duties as executor:

    Your petitioners show that among other be=
quests in said will, are the following;

    " I give and devise to my daughters Betsy and Car=
oline the one half of the following Negroes namely, Nancy
Sally, Priscilla, Leonard (intended for Dennard), Joe, Nancy Jane & Donnel (mean=
ing Doak it is presumed) and their increase to them and
their personal representatives forever.

    " Item I give and devise to my Daughters Polly Walker
Nancy Ray, Betsy, and Caroline the one half of the following
named negroes Nancy, Sally, Priscilla, Leonard (intended for Dennard), Joe,
Nancy Jane, Donnel (intended for Doak it is presumed) and
their increase to be Equally divided between them "

    " Item I give and devise to my son John Latta and
my daughters Polly, Nancy, Betsy, and Caroline, the fol=
lowing negroes Bill, Abe, Lizzy and Harriet to be equally
divided Betwixt them."

    " Item I give and devise to my grand daughter Mary Wal=
ker the one fourth part of all the above named legacies given

[page 2]
to my Daughter Polly Walker ["also" x-out] to her and her
heirs forever"

    Your petitioners John C. Latta, Polly married to John
Walker, Nancy married to Tyre B. Ray, Elizabeth Latta
Caroline Latta and Mary Walker, are the persons men=
tioned and intended in the above clauses & legacies.

They further show that such a division as the first
clause of the will above quoted contemplates, may
be made so as to give one half of the negroes men=
tioned in said clause to your petitioners Betsy and Car=
oline, but that no other division after that, can be
made of the negroes mentioned in the succeeding
clauses above quoted without a sale:

   Your petitioners therefore pray that three suitable
commissioners may be appointed to divide and
allot one equal half of the negroes mentioned in
the first clause to said Betsy and Caroline: And
that all the remaining negroes belonging to the estate
may be sold so as to enable said legatees in the
remaining clauses of the will to have their legacies
paid to them in money according to their respec=
tive rights.

[page 3]
    This case coming on to be heard upon the petition and
the Court being satisfied of the truth of the facts mentioned there=
in, it is adjudged and decreed by the Court, that Henry Whitted
James C. Turrentine, and Pride Jones be appointed com=
missioners to divide the following negroes belonging to the
estate of Sally Latta deceased, namely Nancy, Sally,
Priscilla Demard[sic] Joe, Nancy Jane, and Doak into
two equal shares and assign by lot one share to Elizabeth and
Caroline Latta, & report to the next term of this court

    And it is further ordered by the Court that
 John C. Latta be appointed Commissioner to sell
all the remaining negroes belonging to the estate
at the late residence of Sally Latta
deceased, on a credit of nine months, taking bond
and good security, after 20 days public adver=
tisement, and report to the next term of the Court
