Recorded Feb 1806

In Will Book Volume D there are two consecutive pages numbered 163.  The first page of this will is marked 163, as is the previous page in the book.

Estate Papers comprise 84 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Cozart, James (1806)".

Note 1: Usually when quoting from the will, these passages are word-for-word repetitions what is actually in the will.  In this case, this passage is a paraphrase. For example the author of this Bill of Complaint is confused about who is speaking in the will when the author uses "at the discretion of his executrix", which in the original is "at the Discretion of my Widow".  The meaning is largely intact, however, although the passage is in quote marks, it is not a quote.

State of North Carolina }
   Orange County        } In Equity

          To the honorable the Judge in Equity
          for the County of Orange. The bill of com
          -plaint of William Horton & Lively his wife
          against Sarah Cozort executrix of the last
          will & testament of James Cozort deceased
          & William Lunsford all of the County and
          State aforesaid -------------------

Humbly complaining sheweth unto your Honor your
Orator William Horton & Lively his wife, that in the year
eighteen hundred & five James Cozart the father of your
Oratrix Lively Cozort departed this life, having previously
made his last will & testament, wherein among other things
he devised to your Oratrix Lively "one negro girl named Celia
" one mare bridle & saddle, two cows & calves, one bed & furniture
" & all house hold furniture at the discretion of his executrix -
" & if she contends for any other negro property she is cut off
" the whole but the negro" [See Note 1] - That by his said will he devised
to Edie Cozort a negro woman by the name of Tabb [See Note 2] - Your
Orators further shew unto your Honor, that sometime previous
to the making of his will aforesaid, James Cozort gave to
your oratrix Lively his daughter, the said negro named
Celia afterwards devised to her by his will & the negro woman
Tabb - devised as before state to Edie Cozort - together with
the man mentioned in the devise to your oratrix Lively -
The Sarah Cozort one of the defendants in this bill
was appointed executrix of the said last will & testament
of the aforesaid James Cozort, & legally proved the same
& took upon her its due execution, & that William Lunsford

[page 2]
the other defendant intermarried with Edie Cozort. --

Your Orators further shew that Tabb has become the
mother of two children Hannah & Tamer - That Hannah
is in the possession of Sarah Cozort, & Tabb & Tamer in
the possession of William Lunsford - Your Orators fur
=ther shew unto your Honor that they were married
together in the month of July eighteen hundred & six -
at which time your oratrix Lively was an infant under
the age of twenty one years. - That immediately upon
their intermarriage as aforesaid, your orator William
Horton applied to Sarah Cozort & William Lunsford to know the circum
=stances attending the before mentioned gift or to ascertain
whether any such gift had ever been made - That upon
his application as aforesaid the said Sarah Cozort & William Lunsford utterly
denied any knowledge of the gift of the said negros Celia
& Tabb to your oratrix Lively - & expressed a strong con
=viction that no such gift had ever been made - Your Orator
further applied to the other persons; who he had been in
=formed, were present at the time of the gift, but they also
denied having any knowledge thereof. - You Orator being
induced by this representation to believe that no such gift
had ever een made accepted from ["his" x-out] the executrix Sarah
Cozort the property devised to his wife Lively by her said
father James Cozort - executing at the same time to said
executrix a receipt for the same, & and a release of all claim upon
the estate of the said James Cozort deceased, for any other
negro property - No sooner had your Orator William
Horton received the property as devised, & executed the
receipt & release as above mentioned, than the said Sarah
Cozort declared at various times her knowledge of the
gift, asserting at the same time that your orators

[page 2]
could easily have recovered the negro Tabb if they had
known their rights the truth of which was well known to the said William Lunsford
exulting over the honest credulity
of your orator William & in her own duplicity and
address. -- You Orators state to your Honor that it was
not until within two years last past, that they came
to the knowledge of the above declarations of the said
Sarah Cozort - that immediately upon hearing of them
your orator William went & demanded from the said
Sarah Cozort, the said negro Tabb, & her two children
Hannah & Tamer - tendering at the same time to her the
said Executrix all the property he had received
under the will of the said James Cozort, & which had
not been previously given to her by her said father - he
also demanded from the said William Lunsford the
negros Tabb & her child Tamer - But now so it is -
may it please your Honor the said Sarah Cozort and
William Lunsford combining & confederating with divers
other persons, whose names are at present unknown to your
orators, but who when discovered they pray may be made
parties to this their Bill, with apt words to charge them
how to injure & defraud your orators have refused, & still
do utterly refuse to deliver up to your orators, the said
negros Tabb, Hannah & Tamer -- pretending & giving
out that the said negros never were given to your oratrix
Lively by ["her" x-out] the aforesaid James Cozort her father, or
if any such gift ever was made that your orators
have entirely & utterly lost all benefit therefrom, but
receiving the property devised by the will of the said
James Cozort, & by the receipt & release executed by your
Orator William. -- Whereas the fact & truth is as

[page 3]
your orators expressly charge, that the said negros were
given to your oratrix Lively by her said father James
Cozort, & delivery made of them at the time of such gift
& that the said Sarah Cozort & William Lunsford, well
knew the same, the said Sarah having been present
at the time of the gift & delivery - they further expressly
charge that they received the property devised under an
ignorance of their right, & under a perfect confidence in
the honesty of the said Sarah Cozort, a confidence
shamefully abused - they further expressly charge that
the receipt & release executed by your orator William
was obtained from him by the said Sarah Cozort, by
a fraudulent suppression of the truth, by deceit & im
=position - All which actings, doings, & pretences of the
said confederates are contrary to Equity & good conscience
& tend most apparently to the injury & great wrong of
your orators; In tender consideration whereof and for as
much as your orators are altogether remediless in the
premises at common law, & cannot be relieved but by
the favorable aid of a court of Equity, where matters of
fraud imposition & deceit on property to be discovered
inquired into & relieved against - To the end therefore
that the said Sarah Cozort & William Lunsford, & the
rest of the confederates when discovered, may upon their
corporal oaths, full, true, distinct, & perfect answer res
=pectively make to all & singular the matters & things
herein & hereby charged, & that in as full and ample a
manner as if the same were here again particularly repeat
=ed and interrogated - What the said Sarah Cozort
& William Lunsford may more particularly set forth

[page 4]
and discover whether the said James Cozort father
of your oratrix Lively did not previous to making his
said Will as above mentioned, give to her the negroes
Celia & Tabb, together with other personal property
& what that other personal property was, particularly
whether a mare was not given her at the same time
the negroes were, & whether the mare subsequently devised
to her by her said father was not the same with
had been previously given ? - Whether the said Sarah
Cozart & William Lunsford were not present at the gift
of the above property, who besides were present, & at what
time was it made? Whether your orator William Horton
did not apply to the said Sarah Cozart & Wm Lunsford to give him
information concerning such gift? And is whether upon
such application they did not deny all knowledge of
any such gift, & expressly declare that none such had
ever taken place? Whether she did not believe & know
that your orator William Horton was induced by these
representations to accept the property devised to his wife
you oratrix Lively & execute the receipt & release above
mentioned? - Whether she the said Sarah Cozart did not very soon after the date
of said receipt & release to different people and at dif
=ferent times declare that your orators might easily
have recovered said property, if they had sent for the
same?  & what was her reason for making such declar
=ations? Whether your orator William did not tender to her
all the property he had received from her under the will
of the said James Cozort except such as had been previous
=ly given to his wife your oratrix Lively? Whether your
orator William did not demand of them the said

[page 5]
Sarah Cozart & William Lunsford the said negro
Tabb Hannah & Tamer? Whether the said William
Lunsford did not intermarry with Edie Cozart, to whom
the negro Tabb was devised by James Cozart? And
that the said receipt & release ["may be brought" x-out] executed
by your orator William may be brought into this
honorable Court by the said Sarah Cozort & William
Lunsford, & that the same may be declared to be null &
void, & absolutely set aside as against your orators, & that
the said negros Tabb, Hannah & Tamer, may be decreed
to be delivered up & put into the possession of your Orators
by the said Sarah Cozort & William Lunsford ---
& that the said Sarah Cozort & William Lunsford may
account with your orators for the hire of said negroes
& that your orators may be further & otherwise relieved
in the premises according to Equity & good conscience, &
as the nature & circumstances of their case shall require
-May it please your Honor to grant to your orators
the states writ of subpoena to be directed to the said
Sarah Cozort & William Lunsford, thereby commanding
them at a certain day & under a certain penalty therein
to be inserted, personally to be & appear before your Honor
in this Honorable Court, then & there to answer the premises
& to stand to and abide such order & decree therein as
to your Honor shall seem agreeable to Equity & good
conscience - And your Orators as in duty bound; will

North Carolina }

            The separate answer of William Lunsford to
the Bill of Complaint of William Horton and Lively
his wife exhibited against Sarah Cozort & this Defendant -

           This Defendant saving and reserving to himself
all benefit of exception to the untruths and insufficiencies
in the Complainants' Bill of Complaint contained, for
answer thereto &c saith, That this defendant believes and
admits to be true as charged in the Bill, the death of James
Cozort in the same mentioned and the that he did, about the time in the Bill
mentioned make and duly publish his last Will & testament
in writing whereby he devised and bequeathed as set forth and alledged[sic] in the com
-plainants Bill - He also admits that he intermarried
with Ede Cozort, one of the daughters and legatees of the said
James deceased on the ___ day of May A.D. 1810 or thereabouts
whereby he is advised that the personal estate of the said Ede
became his property: He also admits that he has at this
time the said negroes Tabb and Tamer in his possession
& claims them as his property, fully believing them to be so-
For this Defendant had very little or no knowledge of the Cozort fa
-mily or its affairs until the beginning of the year 1810, being
a Stranger & but lately removed into this County: this defend
-ant not knowing therefore, of his own knowledge, any  thing
of the gift of the said negro Tabb to the said Lively as alledged
by Complainants, he does not deny or admit the same to be
true, but hopes that the Complainants shall be compelled
to make one proof thereof; and the rather[?] because this
defendant is informed, and does believe truly, by the other
Defendant Sarah Cozort, that no such gift was ever made
by the said James deceased within her knowledge, or as she
had any reason to believe - But this defendant humbly
insists that even if such gift had been made as is
pretended, that the said William Horton one of the Complain
-ants, hath waived and lost all benefit under the
same, but having truly and voluntarily as this defendant believes, accepted

[Estate Papers - Answer to Bill of Complaint by Cozort 6 Mar 1812]

                 The answer of Sarah Cozart Execu-
trix of James Cozart decd. to the Bill of Complaint of
William Horton and Lively his wife exhibited against
her and William Lunsford defendants.

                 This defendant saving and
reserving to herself all benefit of exception to the
untruths and Insufficiencies in the Complainants Bill
of Complaint contained --- for Answer there to &c saith

                 The said James Cozart her Testa-
tor departed this life on or about ________________ having
made & duly published his last will &c containing among
other things the following devise to Wit, " I give to my
daughter Lively one negro girl named Celia, one
"Mare, saddle and Bridle, two cows and calves, one
"Bed and furniture, and my household furniture
"at the discretion of my Executrix, and if she contends
"for any other Negro property, she is cut off the whole, but
"the negro." --- The said Testator also by his said
Will gave the negro Tabb mentioned in the Bill to
Ede Cozart his daughter, she since his death
hath intermarried with William Lunsford the other
defendant. --- This defendant admits that she is
in possession of Hannah one of the children of the said
negro Tabb; and that the said Tabb and her daughter
Tamer are in the possession of the said William Lunsford

                 After the intermarriage of the Com-
plainant William with the said Lively the daughter
of this defendant -- the said William Horton appli-
ed to this ["Complainant" x-out] defendant for the Legacy to which his
Wife the said Lively was entitled under the will of the
said James Cozart; and at some time stated that he
had been informed that the said James Cozart had
made a par al[? special?] gift of the said negro Tabb to the
said Lively his Wife - but added that if this was
the fact he had much rather have the property
embraced[?] in the before recited legacy to his wife
then the said negro Tabb - This defendant doth
solemnly and positively deny all or any knowledge
of any gift made by her Testator the said James Cozart
in his life time of the said negro Tab to the said
Lively the Wife of the Complainant - Nor has she any
reason to believe that any such gift as is pretended

[page 2]
was ever made by the said James Cozart to the said Lively
-- She presumes however that her Husband the said James had
some reason to fear that a claim might after this death
be made by his said daughter, or such person as she might
marry, to some of his negro property / other than that devised
to her as aforesaid / or the grant of a pro tem deed gift to be
made by the said James to the Complainant Lively; from
the circumstance of his having inserted in his will; that in
case the said Lively should content for any other negro pro-
perty that she should be "cut off the whole but the negro" - This
defendant was not privy to the making of the said Will
nor to the contents thereof in the lifetime of the said James
nor had she any knowledge of the same till after the death
of the said James ---

                 When the complainant William applied
to this defendant for the legacy of his Wife; she shewed him
a try copy of the said James's Will, which he saw & read
the property mentioned in said devise; and some months
afterwards, to Wit on the 24th Nov. 1805, he freely and vo-
luntarily, wrote and executed the following receipt
and discharge to Wit -- " Received of Sarah Cozart Execu-
trix of James Cozart deceased one negro girl by the name
of Sely /Celia/ one mare, saddle and Bridle, two cows
and calves, one Bed and furniture, and other Household
furniture [x-out] at the discretion of the Widow, which is
according to the Will of James Cozart deceased entitled me
to , and not further, and do hereby say and affirm, that I
will have, nor receive any gift or gifts made or delivered
of negro or negroes made previous to the Will made by
the said James Cozart deceased -- Given under my Hand
this the 24th Nov 1806----

release, and discharge is now in the possession of this de
fendant and ready to be produced & verified as may
be required ----
                 This defendant doth positively deny
that she ever had any knowledge of the Gift pretended
by the Complainant to have been made by the said James
Cozart to the said Lively - nor did she suppress the
truth, or use any art, address, or Influence to induce the
said William the complainant to execute the foregoing
receipt, and release --- This defendant doth positiv-
ly aver that the same was executed by the said William
freely and of his own accord, several months after his in-
termarriage with the said Lively, and after he had
fully examined & investigated as he himself stated, the

[page 3]
grounds of the now pretended gift --- And she doth further
positively deny that she ever ever declared her knowledge at
any time, of the said pretended gift, or asserted that the
Complainants could have recovered the said negroes if they
had known their right as is most falsely alledged by the
complainants --- the complainant Lively being the daughter
of this defendant, held the same place in her affections
with her other children, and she never intended or desired
to defraud her of any property she might have title to by gift
or otherwise.

                 This defendant further answering saith
that the complainants after the receipt of the property de-
vised to the said Lively, as before mentioned, and the execu-
tion of the receipt & release aforesaid, acquiesced
under[?] the same for several years, owning the property
so received, as their own, without setting up claim or title
to the property now claimed, until after the other defendant
William Lunsford had intermarried with this defendants
daughter Ede; to whom the said Negro Tabb was devised
by the said James Cozart and to who this defendant de-
liver'd the said Negroes in pursuance of the said
Will --- nor did the said William the complt. when he
demanded the said Negro from this defendant, tender
to her all the property which she had delivered to him, under
the before recited clause of the said Will; and which
had been given to the said Lively by her father ---

                 This defendant hath faithfully & ho-
nestly executed the trust reposed in her as Executrix
of the said James Cozart by delivering over the legacies
according to his Will --- and she denies all combinations
with the other Defendant William Lunsford, and with any
other person, to deceive or defraud the complainants
and pray hence to be dismissed with her costs in this be
half expended

Sarah Cozort maketh Oath that the several matters of
fact contained in the foregoing answer, as of her own Knowledge
are true, and those not of her own knowledge she believes
