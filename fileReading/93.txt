Additional Comments:
No will book copy located

Original is badly faded, so much of this is guesswork from hints of words.

Estate Papers comprise 50 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Tickle, Conrad (1825)".  These are used to confirm the interpretation of the names of the various legatees found in the will.  The estate papers assert that this testator died intestate in 1825, leaving widow and relict Elizabeth, and the following children: George, Polly who married David Ingle, Joel,, Eli, Daniel, Benjamin, Creecy, Lewis and Simeon Tickle.  The testator held 545 acres in Orange County, and many of the estate papers concern division of these lands among the heirs.

George Huffins purchased "1 Negro Girl" for $281 at the estate sale of 1 Aug 1827, seems to match girl listed in inventory "1 black girl about ten or twelve years old" in Aug 1826.
