Additional Comments:

This is obviously a hand-written copy of the original, undoubtedly filed in Bertie County.  See the Will of his wife, Tabitha Freeman for a more information.

There is a second copy of this same will in the folder, which appears to have been requested by Abner B. Bruce during the legal proceedings concerning the will of Tabitha and AB Bruce's part thereof.
