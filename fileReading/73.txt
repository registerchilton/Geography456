Recorded Nov 1862

The loose will seems to consist of only a very small first page, ending with "...my nieces and nephews (to wit) Hariet...", and none of the rest of the will is found.

Estate Papers comprise 152 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Parrish, Williamson (1862)".  Doctor bill (Dr. E. M. Holt) has charges for visits to testator until 9 Jul 1862.  Administrator's bond was set at $60,000. This is a case of the will written and probate began before the end of the war, but the estate was not fully settled until June 1869, when the land was sold to pay off debts and there was still a deficit.
