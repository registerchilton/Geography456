This Richard appears to be the the son of Elizabeth Howard listed in her will dated 29 Nov 1824 and Thomas Howard, listed in his will of 25 Jul 1815.  "Ritha" is Henrietta / Henritta, etc.

There are several estates under the name of Richard Howard in this county in this time, one dated by the state archives as 1862, and one 1863.

In these papers, Ruthy is listed as Ruthy C. Howard. with a note owed and paid to the estate for $16.10, so perhaps in this case, not the wife listed above?

In the papers labeled "1862", Thomas W. Howard is the Executor, the other Thomas S. Cates is the Administrator.

"Henreete Howard" is listed as deceased by the end of 1862

Also note that there is an estate listed for Sarah and Rutha Howard dated 1863

In other records, there is a Ruth Whitehead who married a Richard Howard in Hillsborough, Orange County, North Carolina on 26 December 1821.
