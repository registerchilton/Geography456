Recorded Jan 1772

No loose will found.

Estate Papers comprise five pages and are found in a folder labeled "Pinkerton, David (1782)", which is 10 years after the will and might not be the same estate as this will. The only historical items found in these is that the Administrator is Anne Pinkerton, which doesn't match any names in the will, that there were two negroes listed in the inventory, but they were unnamed.
