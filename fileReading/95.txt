Note 1: Original is indistinct.  Three letters: first letter could be "T" or "S"; middle letter is "a"; final letter is "p" or long "S".  This name could then be: "Tap", "Tas", "Sap", "Sas"

The original is too faded and indistinct to compare to the will book version, which is found above.  Note in this case the length of time between the writing of the will and its probate - 22 years - some or even all of the people listed in the will may have died before it was probated.

Estate papers comprise 29 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Bowles, William (1850)". Dower was allotted 7 Dec 1849.  Testator owned about 800 acres of land.  Nelson P. Hall was appointed administrator.  Although a sale of negroes is ordered, there are no further records, no inventory, no estate sale in this folder.  Some family history is found in the various papers, and those papers are therefore transcribed below.
