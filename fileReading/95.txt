Note 1: "Carrigan" as a surname associated with the preceding list of grandchildren is not found in the loose will, and is an error in the will book copy.

Estate Papers comprise 27 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Holt, Michael (1842)".  Lands included tracts of 644, 738, 338 3/5, 210 acres for a total of 1,930 3/5 acres, plus lands and mills devised to Wm. R. Holt (@ $6,000), for a total value of $21,106.20.  The exact division of the slaves among the legatees is not listed in the estate papers, so the best source for this information is the will itself
