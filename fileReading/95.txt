Will of William Norwood - 20 Mar 1840

    I William Norwood of Orange County
do make and publish this as my last will
and testament, and do hereby revoke all
former wills and codicils made by me

    I give and devise to all my children, & to
their families forever, a suitable burying
ground, to be laid off by my executors in the
Cedar grove on the river in what is called
the old garden; and I desire that a plat and
the boundaries thereof, under the hands and seals
 of my executors may be proved and registered

I also give and devise to all my children &
to their heirs, forever, the land lying between my
son Josephs' place (formerly Sneed's) and the river
commonly called the "Dark Walk", with a right
of way through it along the river bank to them
their heirs and assigns forever.

    I give and devise to my son John W. Norwood
the parcel of land on which his house stands
(for which I have already made him a deed)
containing nine and one half acres, at the
valuation of five hundred dollars.

   I give and devise to my son Joseph and
his heirs forever, One hundred and thirty acres
of land, which he now has inclosed and under
cultivation, beginning at the southwest corner of

[page 2]
the woods on the Chapel Hill road, opposite or
nearly opposite, the negro house, of J. W. Norwood,
running thence eastward across to a large pop-
lar at the south east corner of said piece of
woods, near the Raleigh road, and thence south-
ward ["and it" x-out] with a survey made by Silas M. Link
and agreeably to said survey, to the beginning
which tract of land, My son Joseph is to receive as
a part of his portion of my estate at the valuation
of six hundred and fifty dollars:

    All the rest of my estate, of what Kind soever
both real and personal, I give and devise to my
beloved wife Robina for and during her natu-
ral life

    At the death of my wife, I give to my son
James H. Norwood one thousand dollars but
if in the opinion of my executors it should be ne=
cessary, they shall vest and secure the said
sum of one thousand dollars, for the sole and
separate use and benefit of my said son's wife
and children, free from his control and from
all liability for the payment of his debts.

    I give and devise one seventh part of all
all[sic] the rest of my estate, of every Kind, and one
thousand dollars over and above one seventh
part thereof, in trust, to my sons John W. Norwood
and Joseph Norwood and to the survivor of
them and the heirs executor or administrator

[page 3]
of the survivor, for the sole and separate use and
benefit of my daughter Jane and her children,
and such Children as she may hereafter have
and free from the control of her husband, and
from all liability for his debts; which they, my said
trustees, and the survivor of them, shall and may
sell, vest, and manage, or retain, as they may
deem most for the advantage of my said daughter
Jane, and her children.  And her receipt shall
always be a full discharge for my said trustees.

    I give and devise, all the rest and resi-
due of my estate, not herein otherwise disposed of,
of every Kind and discription, both realty and
personalty, to my other children; Eliza, John, Wil-
liam, Walter, Joseph and Helen, to them their
heirs executors and administrators, share and
share alike, But my sons John and Joseph
nevertheless, are to hold and take the lands
given to them, at the valuations aforesaid,
respectively, as a part of their shares.

    I give to my executors, full power and
authority to sell, either at public or private sale
all or any portion of my estate, either for the
purpose of paying debts or making a division,
should a sale for either purpose be necessary
and should either of my executors wish to pur-
chase any portion of my estate, then the other executor
shall have the sole power of selling
and conveying that portion: and should both

[page 4]
of my executors wish to purchase the same proper-
ty, then the sale and conveyance shall be made
by some disinterested person, agreeable to the fam-
ily, and appointed for that purpose, under
the hands and seals of my said executors.

    But it is my earnest wish and injunc=
tion, that my black people should be divided,
and not sold, if it can reasonably be avoided:
And in the division, any of my children shall
have the liberty, of retaining as a part of their
share, at valuation any negroes, who have
been put into their possession.

    If at the death of my wife, my estate should owe
any debts, the property may all be Kept together until
they are paid out of the profits, if my executors think
proper.  My executors shall only account for so much
of my perishable estate, as may be on hand at the death
of my wife, but every Kind of perishable property then
on hand, shall be deemed a part of my estate.

    I release to any of my children for whom I may
heretofore have paid debts or upon whom I hold any
obligation for the payment of money, all claims and
demands on account thereof.  I appoint my sons
John and Joseph executors of this my last will
and Testament.  In witness where of I have hereunto
set my hand & seal Signed sealed published & declared this 30
day of March 1840 in presence of

Estate Papers comprise 17 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Norwood, William (1842)".  There are several passing references in these estate papers to a valuation and divisions and sales of the negroes, but the only specific mention by name is listed above.  The documentation on the valuation would be very useful, but it is not found here.
