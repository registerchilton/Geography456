It appears that Christiana Peelor, the testator's widow, was appointed executrix, despite the signature and footnote on the loose will that says this was "Christian Peelor"

Estate Papers comprise 20 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Peelor, Benjamin (1801)".  No family history found, although the sale of slaves is mentioned several times, no slave names.  William Dunnegan bought an unnamed slave for £112/8
