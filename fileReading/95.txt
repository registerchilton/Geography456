Estate Papers comprise five pages and are found in a folder labeled "Montgomery, Sarah (1846)".  The inventory mentions slaves by age.

No further information in estate papers, no names, no account of the sale.
While it is possible that the "boy" and "girl" enslaved persons listed in the will are the younger two persons listed in the inventory, it is more likely that the "boy" Henry, listed in the will, age 23 at the time, is the 25 year-old man listed in the inventory of 1846.  Likewise, Betsy the "girl" in the will, age 16 at the time, is the 18-year-old woman in 1846.

After further analysis, the inventory was returned in 1846.  The date it was taken is not listed, but the slaves were sold 24 Nov 1844, so the ages listed in the inventory are more likely the ages in 1844...
