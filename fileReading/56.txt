Note 1: The will book version inserts "I give to my wife Ann" in the wrong place, and is not a good transcription of the original.  It seems to have been added to both the loose will and the will book copy after they were both written.

This will book copy preserves most of the original spellings from the loose will.  This is not a common practice by the clerks who wrote in will books.  Most of the wills routinely correct (or change) spellings, using the spellings that the clerk was familiar with.

No estate papers found.
