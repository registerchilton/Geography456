Orange County Court Augt Term 1864
The foregoing last will and testament of John Carrington
deceased was duely proven in open Court according
to law and ordered to be recorded

Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume G, page 457
Recorded Aug 1864

Testator appears to be a young man with father and mother living.  This may be the will of a soldier going leaving to go to war, and dying before August 1864

Loose will is written on pages of an unusually narrow ledger sheet. The middle initial comes from name "John C. Carrington" is found in several places in the will, but it is not found in either the body or the signature (not a mark)

Estate Papers comprise six pages found in a folder labeled "Carrington, John (1866)".  The final settling of the will occurred post-surrender.  Some debts were paid in Confederate currency, others in "Green Back money".  No slaves mentioned within these documents.
