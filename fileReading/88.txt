Estate papers comprise 197 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Jones, Nicholas (1830)". Polly Jones married a Coltran.
The records of slaves in these papers are primarily documenting income derived from hiring them to work for other people, due to the fact that the legatees who received them were minors, so there is no clear inventory as such.  There is a lot of information in this collection, but little of it pertained to slaves or other family history.
