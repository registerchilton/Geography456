There are several folders of Estate Papers which may or may not pertain to this will.  The folder labeled "Clark, James (1800)" comprises seven pages with Jesse Clark appointed as administrator. No family history found. This appears to be a better match due to the alignment of the date and the name of the administrator, although from the will the executor seems to be James Clark as both specified in the will and footnoted after the signature.

The folder labeled "Clark, James (1795)" comprises five pages with Mary Clark appointed as administrator No family history found.
