Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume G, pages 430-431
Recorded May 1864

Estate papers comprise three pages and are found in a folder labeled "McAdams, Jehu (1864)". Inventory, dated August 1864, includes "one negro Man some 35 years of age" - this would likely be Thompson

Loose will is in a folder labeled "McAdams, John 1864".  Name is clearly written "Jehu", both on the loose will and in the will book.
