Will of Jonathan Davis - 18 Aug 1823

In the name of God Amen being in a low state of health
but of sound mind and memory I do make and ordain this
my last will and Testament in form and manner as follows
in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and twenty
three (1823) and 18th Augst

Item in the first place it is my wish that all of my
just debts should be paid out of the deb[t]s due me and
such perishable property as my wife and Executor may
think proper After my just debts are paid I loan to my
beloved wife during [her] widowhood the whole of my estate perish-
able personal and real with the priviledge[sic] of giving off
to the children of our marriage at such time as she may
think most advisable any part of said Estate provided She
does not give to any one of them more than their equal and
proportionable part and at her death the Estate is to be so
divided that each child after sd. division shall have had
from first to last an equal share . Item But in case my
wife marries again then instead of loaning her the whole
of my property I loan her until the youngest child comes
of age the tract of land on which I now live with my
negro man Isaac provided however she raises and gives
to each child a good English education (and does not by
any means or any way dispose of sd. property for in that
case the sd. land and negro man shall immediately be
divided among sd. children)

[page 2]
And the remainder of my property I wish divided among
my children when the oldest comes of age   The tract of
land on which Tuttington now lives I wish to be sold at
private sale whenever my wife thinks proper and the
proceeds to be applied to the purchising[sic] a negro girl which
girl when purchased I loan to my beloved wife as long
as she remains a widow or the youngest child comes of age
and then she and her increase to be equally divided among
sd. children.  In case however my wife thinks proper at
any time she may instead of the afore said loaned property
take a childs part which shall be at her own disposal
and the remainder of the estate in that case is to be
kept together until the oldest child comes of age and then
an equal division to be made between them all.  And I
appoint my beloved wife as Executrix and Col. Joseph
Allison of Orange County Executor to this my last will
and Testament. In testamony[sic] whereof I have here
unto affixed my hand and seal      Jonathan Davis (seal)
