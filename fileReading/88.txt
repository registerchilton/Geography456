Guilford County Will Book Volume D, pages 347-352
Recorded Nov 1867 (Guilford County), file no 01269

Many "i"s not dotted, so it makes it a bit harder to transcribe literally.  Surname looks like Moderwell, although it could be Moderwill

Note 1: reservatiere is the French word réservataire meaning an heir who cannot be completely disinherited, and in this usage, the testator is reserving some rights to the property during her life

Note 2: Two Martha Shields are mentioned elsewhere in the will - one the daughter of John Shields and the other the daughter of William Shields...  What is written here looks like "William" written over "John" or "John" written over "William".

Estate Papers comprise 27 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Moderwell, Martha (1879)"  Testatrix died in 1867.

Although this will was written prior to the start of hostilities, it was not proved until after emancipation.

The included transcription of "Estate Papers - Award of William A Graham" contains the family history that was found in that document, however if there is interest in this lineage and / or interest in details concerning this estate.  The will, written before the beginning of the civil war, and the estate being settled after, may prove of interest to historians.

            State of North Carolina

Award of William A Graham

            Whereas sundry matters in difference between the Devisees
and legatees under the last will & testament of Mrs Martha Moderwell Decd.
namely William T Shields, Joseph H Shields, John C. Shields, Mary C
Shields, David Vickers & Rachel his wife, Nathan Couch & Martha his wife
John Couch & Julia his wife, Hybernia Shields & Nannie Shields, have
been referred to me, for my decision and award as an arbitrator by written
articles of agreement under the hands & seals of the parties dated the 9th day
of August A.D. 1870. I caused the said parties to appear before me at my
office in Hillsborough after due notice, on Wednesday the 29th of May 1872
at which time John W Graham & J. R. Strayhorn appeared as their Attornies[sic]
Shields appeared also in person: and I proceeded to here[sic] the allegations
admission and proofs of the several parties from which I find

1st That said will was executed on ____ day of September 1859 that the
testatrix died in October 1867 and the said will was duly proved and
allowed, at November term of Guilford County Court in the same year

2nd That divers provisions of the same making dispositions of negro slaves
and of stock in bank of Cape fear, had became[sic] nugatory, by reason of
the intervention of the cival[sic] war. and the emancipation of the slaves.

[page 2]
                              2

and of stock in the Bank of Cape Fear, had became nugatory, by reason of
the cival war and the emancipation of the slaves and the failure of the
Bank before the death of the testatrix [seems to repeat the last few lines]

3d That James S Shields and Charles C Shields two of the principal devises
and legatees under said will departed this life before the death of the testatrix
whereby she died intestate as to the property real and personal devised
and bequeathed to them

4th That although there was but an inconsiderable amount of indevledness[?]
against the said estate on the account of the testatrix, there ware large debts
by reason of her suretyship for the firm of J & R & J Sloan who ware
duly discharged therefrom as bankrupts, whereby it became necessary
to sell a considerable portion of the real estate of the testatrix, and
under a license obtained by the Executor according to the statute in
such case provided, he did sell the Mansion & Store House & lots in the
town of Greensborough[sic], and some twenty acres of the tract of land
adjoining the said town belonging to said estate, all which was devised
to the said Joseph H & William T Shields Jr.

5 That by mutual agreement of the said legatees, the Executor was
required to make no sale of the personal estate but has delivered over
the Furnature[sic] and plate of the estate, and it has been satisfactory
distributed among the female legatees, the spectacles and watch
of the testatrix having been stolen & never came to his hands
