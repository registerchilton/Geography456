Recorded May 1811

Estate Papers comprise 72 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Shutt, Henry (1811)". Unusual items in estate sale: over 5,000 rabbit skins, 79 raccoon skins, 192 cat skins, 6 otter skins, 585 muskrat skins, wool, hatter's blocks, 1 lb 9 oz of quicksilver, hatter's bows, etc.  This appears to be the stock of a hatmaker.

One of the documents is a complaint or suit brought by Nancy Shutt, daughter of the testator, against James B. Dickey.  Dickey married the testator's widow in 1817 and was appointed guardian for the testator's four "infant" (minor) children, namely Nancy, Clemment, Henry and Peggy.  Dickey was removed by the court and replaced with Thomas Clancy.  Guardianship was secured by four $2,000 bonds.  The same petition states that the testator at the time of his death "owned the following Negro Slaves", unfortunately followed by a blank that was never filled in with their names.  Their worth listed as $2,600, which may be the correct price at the time for the eight slaves listed in the inventory. The suit was settled in 1824 by charging those who served as Dickey's securities to his Guardianship bond.

The suit complains that the slaves have been "removed out of the state", believed to be to Mississippi.

Clem Shutt, one of the legatees died as a minor.

Within these estate papers, for reasons unknown, is found the Will of Samuel Simpson of Craven County. See Will of Samuel Simposon
