Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume E, pages 208-209
Recorded Nov 1829

Unlike many county clerks, the person who transcribed this loose will into the will book preserves many of the original non-standard spellings found in the loose will. Letter "i" frequently not dotted and the apostrophe in "O'Daniel" is not used, so the name appears to be "O Daneel" throughout.  Apostrophes added here for clarity.

Estate Papers appear to be in folder labeled "O'Daniel, Henry, Sr. (1813)", with an undated estate sale and Thomas Hastings as Executor.  Hastings appears to be the executor for the 1813 estate sale, too, though.
