[Estate Papers - Answer by Sarah Laws to Petition 2 Dec 1820]

State of North Carolina  }
     Orange County       }    In Equity

    To the Honorable the Judge of the Court of Equity for Orange
    County,

                  The Answer of Sarah Laws to the Bill of
                  Complaint of Ezekiel Laws & Others -

    This Defendant Saving &c for Answer to So much of the Bill
as is material, Saith, She admits that George Laws departed this Life
in June 1815[Note 1]. having made & published his last Will, which contained
the Devises and Bequests set forth in the Bill: but for more Certainty she
begs to refer to the Will itself -- that after the Probate of the Will, She
accepted her said Legacy and took Possession of the Lands devised to her,
and made Choice of two Slaves Jack & Hager --

    She admits that Since the death of her Husband she took
William Watson into her employment as a Cropper & Overseer, she being
unable to carry on her Plantation to advantage and manage her negroes
And Stock, And She admits that she and Said William had once agreed
to marry.  She denies that she is in mean Circumstances or of profligate
morals.  He is [???] and Sometimes intemperate: but he has managed
well the Concerns of this Defendant - She is advised that being a free Agent
She is not accountable to Complaints for agreeing to marry William
Watson, nor has his Character any thing to do with the Subject in dispute
between her & Complainants. For She is advised, She hath ["She has" x-out] a right
to use the property given to her by her Husband in any way she pleases
provided she doth not waste it nor remove it beyond the Jurisdiction
of the Court; And She hopes this Court will not undertake to control
her rights as a free Agenda, merely because her Manners or her
                                                        (Conduct)

[page 2]
Conduct do not please Complainants.  She hopes, and she believes she
could prove the fact to be so, were it at all necessary, that her general
Course of life is quite as unexceptional at that of some of the
Complainants -- It is her misfortune to be a Step Mother to Several
of the Complainants, who are Children of her second Husband by a
former Wife: And some of them seem to take a malicious Pleasure
in traducing her Character and throwing Obstacles in her Way.

    As to the Charge that she has consumed, destroyed and
disposed of nearly all the property left to her, except the Land & the Slaves
She saith that the said Charge is untrue,  She received two Horses.  Of
them one died from the Cholic[sic] or the Rot[?] or some other Complaint: Her
Mare has had a Colt which is nearly three Years old, & She had the mare
and this colt still.  She has also purchased another Mare --- The two Beds with the Furniture are still in her
Possession - likewise the Desk, & shot Gun - he still has the Portion of Household
and Kitchen Furniture which was allotted to her, except some small articles
which are broken or Worn out: The Same is the Case with the Working Tools.
Some have been worn out, & others made - There are upon the whole as valuable
as when she received them - She received two Cows - She now has fire Head of
Cattle - She has a many Hogs as she received, she believes - her stock of Hogs
is thriving - She had almost the same number of sheep that she received --
-- The Property which she has exclusive of the Negro Slaves, is of
more Value than that will to her by her Husband; And she is at a loss to
find out, how Complainants can pretend to this Court, that she has wasted
her Property - The Negro Woman Hager has had two children, Aaron
& Clim, and she has had the Trouble and expense of raising them thus
far ---

    This Defendant purchased sundry Articles at the Sale of her
Husband's estate: And to pay this Debt, she leased her plantation &
                                                             ( hired

[page 3]
hired the negro fellow Jack to James Latta - And then she rented a small
place for a residence; not in a distant Part of the County but distant only
about four miles from her Plantation and nearer by three Miles, to Hillsborough,
than her Plantation --- And this is the abandonment of her Plantation mentioned
in the Bill - Those of the Complainants who have stirred up this War of Malice
against her, knew well for what purpose she had leased her plantation
to Mr Latta and hired her negro Fellow Jack --

    She denies that it is her intention to sell the Land &
the Slaves, so that the Slaves shall be carried off beyond the Jurisdiction of
this Court: She denies that she intends to remove to distant Parts - It is true
She has said that if Complainants did not cease their Persecutions of her, she
must go away to get some Peace in this World, for they live near her
Plantation and have not ceased since her Husbands death to make her wretched
as they well could ---

    As to the charge of her intending to sell the Negroes,
She for answer saith, that some of the Complainants, Particularly Leonard
Laws have tampered with her slaves Untill they have become unmanageable by
her. She has frequently caught him in her her Kitchen at a late Hour of the
Night in Conversation with her Slaves, and altho she did not hear the
Conversation, she had to doubt, its Object & Purpose were to encourage their
insolence to this Defendant, and induce her to agree, to what one of his
Friends often urged her to do, that is, to give up the Negroes Hager & her
Children, to the Complainants Leonard & Ezekiel Laws, & let them divide
said Negroes ["then & there" x-out]

    James Latta was the Guardian of her Children: &
her Negroes having become in a great degree unmanageable by her, she prepared
to sell them to Mr. Latta.  He knew what title she had,  She offered to sell
him such title as she had under the Will, and proposed to him to consult
Mr Norwood Esqr. on the Subject & shew Mr Norwood the Will - Mr
Latta first agreed to purchase and the Price was agree on -- Afterwards
                                                                    (he

[page 4]

He declined the Purchase - She had before offered to sell the Negroes in
the same ways to Col. Simms, Showing him the Will that he might see what
Title she had - She never attempted to sell any other estate in the said
Negroes than that which she derived under the Will - She denies that they
ever attempted  to sell the said Negroes to William Forsythe - She went to
Mr Forsythe's House, to get him to rent her Plantation.  He was not at
Home: & this Defendant told his Wife her business, and mentioned that if
she did not sell the Negroes to Mr. Latta, she would let them go or hire
with her Plantation -- She denies that she ever threatened to sell the
Said Negroes otherwise than as she has before set forth - She denies that
she has offered or threatened to send them away beyond the Jurisdiction of
this Court - It is true People have been tampering with her to do so:
as this Tampering has been, she has good reason to believe, by Agents of the
Complainants, that Something might be laid hold off to embarrass and
distress her -- She again repeats that she hath been most unkindly
treated by the leading Complainants in this Case, who have evinced towards her
ever since the death of her Husband a disposition to drive her out out of this
Neighbourhood and get possession of her little Property ---

    She admits she hath had one Child since the death of her
Husband - She was pregnant at the time of this Death - She denies that she
hath married William Watson - She admits Watson did [prove?] a [Sxxxxx???]
for the Marriage - Watson lived with her as a Cropper and [???] on her
own plantation and is now living on the same Plantation with her, but not
in her [???] - She never set up any other Title to the Negro Slaves than
such as she derived[?] under the Will in her offered[efforts?] to sell or warrant any other
Title, & she has always referred to the Will for her Title - She denies all
continuation &c & prays to be dismissed with her Costs ----

    Sarah Laws maketh Oath that the several Matters of fact
contained in this her Answer which are of her own Knowledge are true, and those

    Humbly complaining sheweth unto your
Honor, your Complainants of the County of Orange
that George Laws formerly of the County of Orange
duly executed & published his last will bearing
date the 24th day of June 1815 for the purpose
of passing both his real and personal estate, & died
in November following and that at November
Term of Orange County Court for that year the
said will was proved & is now of record and Leon=
ard Laws and Ezekiel Laws two of the executors
named therein took out letter testamentary &
assumed the duties of the said office and possessed
themselves of all the estate of the said testator &
assented[?] to the legacies hereinafter set forth

    Your Complainants shew unto your Hon=
or that said testators by said will devised the
lands whereon he then lived lying in Orange
County & Containing 365 [acres], to his wife Sarah Laws

[page 2]
during her widowhood, also 2 negroes her choice, two
horses her choice, two beds & furniture her choice one
desk, a third part of the household and kitch=
en furniture and working tools & a third part of
his Cattle hogs & sheep, & if she should marry
all of said property was to revert to his executors,
the land to be equally divided among his sons,
and the other property among all his children, in the
same manner as the rest of his estate-. And after
making a nominal legacy to the heirs of his deceased
sons William, George, & Thomas respectively, he
gave all the residue of his estate to his executors,
the personal property to be sold by them on a credit
of twelve months, taking bond & security, and the lands
on a credit of three years taking bond & good secu=
rity; the proceeds of the personal property to be equally
divided among all his children then living including
such as might thereafter be born in lawful wed=
lock; among his sons only, ["including" x-out] then

be born in lawful wedlock: and he appointed

her widowhood, to take effect in possession upon the
termination of said widowhood either by death or
marriage, the sons, of the land ["as tenants in com-" x-out]
["mon" x-out] money, equally to be divided between them
and all of said children of the rest of the proper=
ty equally to be divided among them, They are also
advised that as the executors were by the will di=
rected to sell the said land & divide the money
that the same was thereby converted into personal=
ty and would partake of the incidents of per=
sonal estate. And that they with the defendants
were interested in like manner in that portion
of the estate which passed under the residuary clause
and was directed to be sold and divided at
the term of the testators death, and that the por=
tion of the testator land so directed them to be
sold & the money divided also became perso=
nalty & partook of the nature and incidents
of personal property

    Your Complainants further shew unto your
Honor that the said George Laws was possessed at the
time of his death of a large estate consisting of
lands, slaves, money on hand, debts due to him
& personal property of various kinds, & that his said
sons Ezekiel and Leonard as his executors poss=
essed themselves of all his estate, and soon
after his death sold his land slaves and other
property not given to his said widow for a
large sum of money namely for about $7006.90[?]

[page 4]
And that the said Sarah Laws the widow
died in the year 1850 whereby the particular
estate given to her by said will in the lands slaves
and other property mentioned in the said
will terminated, and the defendant Ezekiel
Laws hath since sold said lands, & slaves &
their increase to a considerable number, and
other property for a large sum namely
for the sum of $6113:75 and for as much as the
said testator owed very little at the time of his
death and left ready money enough on hand
to pay all his debts and the charges of admin=
istration, the whole of the said sales both first
and second ought to have been paid over to the
legatees thereof according to the terms of the
said will.

      Your Complainants further shew unto your Hon=
or that the said Guilford Laws died in Orange
County intestate in the year 1837 and there was
no administration on his estate until 18__ when the
Complainant Moses Leathers was duly appointed
his administrator by the County Court of Orange County,
that Margaret Laws died in the year 1816 as
infant less than one year old & no adminis=
tration was taken upon her estate until the year
18__ when the said Moses Leathers was also ap=
pointed her administrator by Orange County Court

ant Edward Harris, and the said Sally is mar=
ried to Samuel Cole who has sold all

said defendants Ezekiel Laws and the said
William Laws and requested them to come to a

their said legacies, but the said Ezekiel and
William refuse to do so.  And for as much as Your
Complainants are remediless in the premises save

properly Cognizable, to the end therefore that the
said Ezekiel Laws and William Laws may
be required to come to a true and full settlement

ants their said said[sic] legacies with lawful in=
test on the same, and that such other and
further relief may be granted to you Complain=

                   In the Court of Equity
                   for the County of Orange

    The seperate Answer of Ezekiel Laws to
    the Bill of Complaint of John Laws & others
    exhibited agst. said Ezekiel & others in this
       Honorable Court

This Defendant saving &c for answer to so
much of the said Bill as he is advised
it is material & necessary for him to answer
answering saith, that it is true as alledged
that one George Laws died in the year
1815 having first made & published his
last Will & testament of which a true
copy is appended to Complainants Bill
that said Will was admitted to probate
as alledged & that this Defendant who
was named Executor, therein, qualified
as such, but it is not true that this Deft.
possessed himself of the Estate as charged
in the Bill, but on the contrary the while
of said estate was taken by his Co-Execu
=tor Leonard Laws who managed the busi
=ness exclusively as the sole acting Exr.
& no part of the property devised and
bequeathed in said Will came into the
hands of this Deft. during the life time
of said Leonard Laws who died in the
month of _____ in the year 1844

[page 2]
                   2
Further answering Deft. admits that the parties
named in the Bill are all, as he believes co-
-rectly named & it is true that in pursuance
of the directions of the Testator the property
was sold for the amount stated in the
Bill towit $7006:-- that within the time
prescribed by Law for the settlement of
estates, the parties interested under the
Will of the aforesaid George Laws, anxious
to have a speedy & satisfactory settle
=ment of all questions which might
arise under said Will as also that
a true account of the manner in
which the said Exrs. had performed
the trust reposed in them, (thsi Defendt.
doth aver as within his personal Kno
=ledge,) agreed to refer all such ques-
=tions & accounts to the Hon. Duncan
Camerson, in whose capacity & in-
-tegrity all the said parties had full
confidence & that accordingly at
the Stagville Store in the aforesaid
County of Orange, the said persons
who were of age & the regularly ap
=ponted Guardians of such as were
minors as also the acting Executor
aforesaid were met by Judge Cameron
& a full & thorough examination of all
the matters referred to him were had
which meeting he thinks took place

[page 3]

                  3
in the month of ______ in the year 1817
that for the satisfaction of all concerned Judge
Cameron drew out an elaborate report of the
accounts between the said Exr. & the
Devisees & Legatees under said Will which
was read & explained to them all & they
& each of them, expressed therewith entire
satisfaction: that Judge Cameron thereupon
stated to all concerned that the said re-
=port ought to be returned to the County
Court & recorded, which as this Defendant
then understood & now believes was done
accordingly, but since the service of the
present Bill upon him, he has had diligent
search made in the Office of said County
Court not only of the Records made at
that time of similar Reports but also
among the files of returns made of simi
=lar settlements for that year & some sub-
=sequent years, but he hath not been so
fortunate as yet to find said report.

Further answering this Defendant doth aver
that in pursuance of said Report the
acting Executor aforesaid together with this Deft. delivered to
the several Devisees & Legatees named
in said Will their respective portions
in & of said property & money & that
all the said parties expressed their
entire satisfaction with the settlement &
this Defendant prays the benefit thereof & of the

[page 4]
                4
lapse of time, now over thirty five years
as if the same had been specially
plead by him - Further answering he
is advised that the charge in Compl-
=ainants Bill of the legal effect of the
sale aforesaid being a conversion out
& out of the real estate into personalty
& drawing after it the incidents of
such property, is not the proper constr-
=uction of the clause of said Will
directing the sale, but of this question
he asks this Hon. Court to consider
& adjudge, that he may be pro
=tected in the premises.  Further an
=swering he is advised that by said
Will the Complainants & Defendants took
a vested remainder in the estates real
& personal which were given to the widow
for life, as also in the residuary estates
given by said Will - Further answer
=ing he saith that after the death
of the said widow, this Dft. in pur
=suance of the directions in said Will
proceeded to sell the Lands & slaves
which had been in possession of the
said widow & the amount of said
sales was $6113:75 as will more fully ap
=pear by reference to the returns of sale
made by this Deft. to the County Court of Orange

[page 5]
                     5
at the ______ Sessions thereof 185__ of
which said returns a true copy is
hereunto appended & prayed to be
take as part of this his answers.

Of the sums so received by the Deft.
from the sale so made since the
death of the widow the returns by
him made to the County Court, contain
a full & accurate statement & for the
portions thereof to which Complainants
are entitled, this Deft. is & has been
always ready to account, but
it will be seen by reference to the
Will that the Lands were to be
sold on a credit of (3) three years
& the notes given for the same are
not yet due: the portion arising
from the sale of personal property is
in the hands of the Deft. & ready to be
paid for to whomsoever this Hon
Court shall adjudge it to be due
under the devises & bequests of the
said Will.  Further answering
Deft. admits the death of Margaret
Laws occurred at the time mentioned
in the Bill & the recent qualification
of Moses Leathers as her Admr. some
thirty six years after her death, but
he doth not admit the claim of her

[page 6]
                       6
of her[sic] admr. to be well founded, as
he hath already stated that the entire
amount arising from the first sale was
paid over by the acting Exr. to those
entitled under the Will & if no
Letters of Administration were taken
out on her estate previous to the
distribution of said sum, he avers that
her share was divided among the other
Devisees & Legatees & no part of the
proceeds ever came to the hands
of this Deft. as Exr. - This Deft doth
insist that the lapse of time since
the said first settlement is a bar
to the claim of said Admr. & prays
the benefit of the same as if here
offered by way of a plea thereto

Further answering he admit the
sale by Cole & wife to Complt.
Morris. -- He further admits
that the aforesaid Moses Leathers hath
taken out Letters of Administration
on the estate of Guilford Laws
but he doth not admit but denies
that said admr. is entitled to any
thing at his hands arising from

[page 7]
                    7
the first sale, for the reason theretofore
assigned in regard to the other Devisees
& Legatees, viz that the said Guilford
received his portion thereof by the hands of his Guardian from the
acting Exr. at the same time the
other Devisees & Legatees did.

This Deft. further answering saith
whatever sums of money were in poss-
=ession of said George Laws at the
time of his death, came to the hands
of this Executor Leonard Laws who
were the sole acting Exr. as hereinbefore
stated, that for such sum he fully
accounted upon the reference to
Judge Cameron & was charged there-
=with in the settlement then made
& this Deft. doth aver that said
settlement was & was intended
& understood by all the parties
to be, final & inclusive of
all the estate, money & effects
then in the hands of said Exr.
Leonard Laws & therefore
in regard to said money
- charged by the Bill to have
been left by the Testator George
Laws, this Deft. is advised that
the time elapsed since said
final settlement, is in this Court

[page 8]
8
a bar to any claim therefor & he insists
upon the same as if here specially
plead.

    Further answering Deft. avers
that he hath been at much costs & charges
in attending to the duties of his trust
& asks that he may be allowed such
amount so expended, as also the
usual Commission allowed by law
upon the estate which hath come
to his hands.

              - Denying all fraud
&c, this Deft. prays to be hence
dismissed with his costs in this
behalf most wrongfully sustained

Note: This is obviously from approximately 1810 because the monetary units are primarily in pounds, shillings and pence, but there are also some references to dollars and cents, so the reader can draw their own conclusions.  This is the inventory for the estate of a George Laws, however it seems that the persons named George Laws identified during this time in this county already have inventories that differ from this, so it is listed for purposes of completeness, although the utility of this data is not known.
