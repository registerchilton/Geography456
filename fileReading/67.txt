Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume F, pages 458-462
Recorded Aug 1850

There are several versions and copies of the loose will.

Note 1: Some copies of this will list "two Children (Bill & Ceasaree[?])" at this point.

Estate Papers comprise 453 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Merritt, William H (1851)".  Testator died 3 Jul 1850.  One estimate of the value of this estate was $50K-$60K.  At the time of the inventory, there was, for example, 16,000 pounds of bacon listed. Legatee George Wynn asserts in a petition in the Fall Term of 1862 of the Court of Equity that he is 62 years of age. William Henry Merritt, the testator's son was "of an imbecile understanding although married and the father of several children".  He was later found insane by a jury, which is why there was a trustee appointed in the will for life, and John W. Carr was later appointed his guardian by the court.  George Wynn's duties as trustee were transferred to Patterson H. McDade in the fall of 1862, giving $15,000 bond (1 Jan 1863).

There are numerous passing mentions to Merritt family history and to slaves.  Examples include

By cash paid for Blankets &c for hired negroes  5.50
 "  "    "   Stepney                            3.00
 "  "    "   Negro Part for 3 collars            .75
To cash Recd. Valuation 2 Negroes $600 1/2    300.00
[elsewhere the names Lucy and Henry are attached to this transaction.  This account was dated 15 Mar 1855]

...in addition, there is a doctor's bill for treating the various slaves.  Quinine, is listed as a medicine in use.  At the time it was used to treat a variety of fevers.  Slaves listed in the will are mentioned by name in the medical bill.

As with other collections of estate papers of this size, it is assumed that researchers interested in these families can find additional information by focusing on these, and that this is not an exhaustive transcription of the estate papers themselves.
