Despite the existence of this will, Daniel's estate was adjudged as "intestate".  It appears this is due to the fact that Daniel had lost contact with many potential heirs who had moved away from Orange County and many of these heirs were identified later.  This seems to have prompted a review of Absalom's estate and distributees.

Estate Papers comprise 170 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Turrentine, Daniel (1854)".  There is a great deal of family history in this folder mentioned incidentally as several generations of heirs in various locales asserted their relationships to this testator or his brother, Absalom Turrentine.  Some of that family history is transcribed below, however if this lineage is of interest, these papers should be more thoroughly searched beyond the few transcripts included here.

Susan Turrentine (sister of testator) married George Wilson.

Francis L.  Turrentine (daughter of James Turrentine, niece of testator) married Aaron Lockhart and lived in Yazoo County and Pontotoc County, Mississippi

Martha L. Turrentine is identified as Allen Turrentine's widow and relict and lived in Carroll County, Mississippi

Morgan C. Turrentine lived in Taladega County, Alabama.

Samuel Turrentine (son of James Turrentine, nephew of the testator) lived in Harris County Georgia.

Absalom Turrentine died in Jul 1856
