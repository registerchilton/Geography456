Francis Asbury, Thomas Coke and Richard Whatcoat were well-known traveling Methodist ministers, significant in the early history of Methodism in the United States. They were abolitionists, so giving the enslaved persons to these Bishops may have had the effect of freeing them.

Estate Papers comprise 25 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Moreland, Francis (1809)".  These concern the allotment of dower and partition of lands to the legatees named in the will.  No further family history found.  No inventory of the slaves, etc.
