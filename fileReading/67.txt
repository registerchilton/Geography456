Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume D, pages 510-511
Recorded Aug 1817

The original, loose will has the surname as "Scarlet" and the will book copy has "Scarlett". Note, however, that the testator's signature on the original, loose will, is "Scarlett"

Estate Papers comprise 12 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Scarlett, Stephen (1836)"  This folder appears to contain items from more than one estate.  One estate pertains to a James Scarlett who died intestate leaving a widow Hannah.  The inventory in this folder was written by James Scarlett, Executor of Stephen Scarlett, filed Feb 1836, and perhaps taken at the death of this will's widow, Sally Scarlett, and no family history found.
