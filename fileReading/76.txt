Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume D, pages 158-159
Recorded Aug 1805

Numerous "t"s not crossed and "i"s not dotted so "Caly" might be either "Caly" or "Caty"

No estate papers found, although an administrator in the estate of a George Friddle was appointed in 1791, and an estate sale was held 6 May 1788, which appears to pertain be a different George Friddle as this George Friddle was already deceased several years before this will was written.
