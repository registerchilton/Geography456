Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume F, page 238
Not dated, proved Nov 1841

Name on cover looks a bit like "Huffind".

Handwriting of will is poor, and the will book copy is not very good. No executor named. No witnesses.  Quite surprising that this was recorded, but no entry in the will book about it being proved.

Estate Papers comprise 54 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Huffhines, John (1840)".  Much of this material concerns the widow disputing the will and petitioning for dower rights.
John Huffhines died in October 1840.

Note 1:  devisavit vel non: a document that sets forth the questions of fact pertinent to the validity of an alleged will and is sent from a court of probate or chancery to a court of law for a jury trial for judgment as to the validity of the will.
