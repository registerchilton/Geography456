Estate Papers comprise three pages and are found in a folder labeled "Patterson, David A (1865)".  These consist of an inventory that is too faded to be transcribed with any confidence, but lists 269[?] acres of land, hogs, cattle, sheep, a horse and colt, a wagon, plow and gear, 2 beds and bedsteads. This is about 75% of what is written there.
