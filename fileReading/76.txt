NB = Nota Bene

Note 1: This "NB" or Nota bene is inserted with marginal legibility, so not quite sure what this is. It is right between the bequests and the assignment of executors, so might be the name of a forgotten legatee.

Note 2: The entire phrase is unusual.  It says "worthy friend" followed by his son's name.  It says "Executors" but there is only one name left.  The crossed-out name is almost completely obscured.  Perhaps "Danl" or "Basil", surname "Joseph"? "Light"?

Estate Papers comprise 15 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Barbee, Benjamin (1828)". Benjamin Barbee departed this life in the year 1827.
