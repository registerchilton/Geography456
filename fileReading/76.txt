Recorded Aug 1800

Estate Papers comprise 14 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Dunnagan, Sherwood (1809)".
"Amelia is now twenty seven or twenty eight and intermarried with William Carrington about nine years ago last June." This assertion by Nancy Newton was unfortunately undated, guessed to be Aug 1816.

Mary, AKA Polly married Moses Leathers.
