No estate papers found.

Some Estate Papers found in folder (57 pages) labeled "Thompson, John (1843)", which appear to be too early, and nothing else matches this will other than the name of the testator, so very unlikely to be the same estate.  Testator of this earlier estate died 1843.  He appears to have left no will, so some transcripts are listed here.
