        In the name of God Amen!
    I William H. Brown of Hillsboro North
Carolina do make and publish this as my
last will and testament, hereby revoking all other
wills made by me.

    I give and devise to my wife Mary L. Brown
during her life or widowhood all my property
and estate of every kind the money part of the
estate to be vested according to her best judg=
ment by my executor as her agent in her name
and the proceeds or interest to be paid to her
annually or semiannually as the case
may be. And she is charged with the support
and maintenance of all my children who
May remain with her as a part of her family.

    If my wife should mar[r]y again, an event
not contemplated by me, and merely possi=
ble in that event I give her just what she
would be entitled to by law if I had died
intestate, & the remainder of my estate to be
divided equally among all my children
in the manner hereinafter directed.

    At the death of my wife I give and devise
all my estate to my children equally to be divi=
ded among them. But the share of my daughter
Lucy R Gordon wife of William B. Gordon, I give
to my son Henry N Brown in trust for her sole and

[page 2]
separate use and benefit, and to be free from
all liability for the debts or contracts of her said
husband; And as a part of her share she is to have
the house built by Mr. Gordon between my Mill
and Tan yard and two acres of ground
around it. And the share of my daughter Mary
Jane wife of John M. Wolf, I give to my son
Henry N Brown in trust for her sole and separate
use and benefit, and to be free from
all liability for the debts or contracts of her said
husband. And the receipts of my said daughters
in writing shall be a full discharge for whatever
they may receive from said trustee, who may either
permit them to have the possession and use of the
property or hold it himself & pay the proceeds to
them as he may think best.

    And I give full power to my wife with the
approbation in writing of my son Henry to
sell any part of said property which they
may deem it advisable to sell; the proceeds
of such sales to stand in the place of the property
and to be held and applied as this will directs
the property itself to be held and applied.

And further I give power to my wife from time to time to advance
to any of my children such portions of their
shares of the property as their circumstances
may require, as she can spare without injury
to the rest, not however to be equal to their full

[page 3]
shares, & to be accounted for in the final settle=
ment of the estate.

    And my executor is to permit my wife to have
the possession of all the perishable personal pro=
perty for her use as this will provides, and
he is not to be accountable for any thing of
it but such as remains when the estate is
to be divided.

    And I appoint my son Henry N. Brown ex=
ecutor of this my will.

    Signed Sealed published and declared by
me as my last will and testament this
