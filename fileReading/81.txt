Answer
    Smith told me that he wanted to get
    the old negro[See Note 1] shaved and fixed up
    to look decent that the negro was
    a fraid that some speculator would
    get him and would not fix himself

Question by Defendant
    You have heard the examination of the
    other witnesses pleas[e] to state all you
    know upon the points to which they have
    spoken

Answer
    I was at the sale of Fan I do not
    think Smith was present when Fan was
    put up or at least I did not see him I
    saw him some five or ten minutes before the sale between
    the Kitchen and the house and I did
    [not] see him after wards until some interruption
    took place at the sale when I saw him
    come up from towards the Kitchen when he
    came up the negro was crying at some where
    between 800 or 1000 at which time

              22
Turner seemed to be about to knock her off
when Smith said to him stop do not knock her
off yet for you are not selling a cow or a horse
but a valuable negro give the people
time and I do not recollect any person
asking any thing about the soundness of the
negro I do not recollect that I heard any
of legatees say anything as to the soundness of
the negro I saw Samuel Crawford and Alfred
Pickard at the sale and Henry Pickard
and John O'Daniel were on the ground
and I supposed that they was attending to the
sale but I do not remember that I saw them
I heared[sic] Samuel Crawford say before the sale
in a conversation I had with him say that
the girl was a sound negro.  I have heared
Alfred Pickard and Samuel Crawford both
say that the negro was sound that they were
both present at the sale and the negro
was not warranted at all and that the
virdict[sic] was obtained against William Smith
by the evidence of witnesses that did not tell the
truth and that they were influenced by
other men these declarations was made
while the suit was pending I do not think
that Smith cauld[sic] have come from the Kitchen
to where the sale was going own[sic] without my
seeing him from the position I was standing
for I was standing within a fu[few] feet of the crier
all the time the sale was gaing on

    the witnesses who had sworn falsely and
    if so who did they say there were
              {objected to by plffs}

Answer
    I have heard Pickard say several
    times that Peyton Cates had sworn
    falsely and I have heard Crawford
    say that said Cates and Manley Andrews
    had sworn falsely

Question by the Plantiffs
    When did this conversation between you
    and Pickard and Crawford happen
    how long after Virdict[sic] in the Case of
    Cheek against Smith

Answer
    the first conversation between Crawford
    and myself took place the same night that the
    Verdict was rendered by the Jury on our
    Way home.  And he told me ["in" x-out] what I
    have related in that Conversation and
    in several subsequent conversations ["he told me" x-out]
    for about Ten day after wards he repeated to
    me the same thing for he was in my imployment[sic]
    at that time and not many days after the
    Trial before the Court I heared Mr Pickard
    say what I have related Mr Crawford and
    and myself walked some ten miles together that
    night on our way home ["I am confident" x-out]
    I have not doubt about the last fact

I was a near neighbour to James M Minnis
deceased and Visited frequently during
the last two year of his life during that
tie I saw the negro woman ["Fan" x-out] After for
she very often visited my negroes and I consid

she was worth as much as the brought at the sale
I was summoned as a witness by Smith in the
case of Cheek and Smith but was not examined

Question by the Defendant
    who did Crawford and Pickard say
    influenced the witnesses who they said

["Question by the Defendant" x-out] I was present when
Turner put up the negro woman Fann
for sale.. Turner after stating the tirms[sic]
of the sale told them that he was going to sell
a likely negro woman though her appearance
would prove that I do not remember that
he said anything about warranting the soundness
of the negro if he had warranted the soundness
I think that it would have attracted my
attention for I went there for the purpose
of buying the negro and I stood within five

[page 25]
              25
or six feet of the crier all the time the sale was
going on and think I heard all that was
said for I paid as much attention to
the sale as I ever did to any sale, I heared
a man from Chatham who is called May
after the negro had been up some short
time enquire[sic] what sort of a title would
be given Turner said that the Executor
would make such title as was vested
in him as Executor I do not remember that
May made any inquire as to the soundness --
Fan was as sound healthy looking woman
as I ever saw.. Henry Pickard one of the
legatees before the sale told me that she was
a sound negro I think William Smith was
not present when Fan was put up for sale
I saw him and Turner between the house
and the Kitchen just before Fan was put up
and Smith went off towards the Kitchen
and Turnt brough[t] Fan round the eat
end of the house and imm[ed]iately put her
up, I saw Smith when he came up afterward
round the house to where they was selling when
Fan was Crying at between seven & eight
Hundred dollars as I think and Turner
seemed like knocking her off then Smith
told him to hold on or something to that
effect Turner spake in a loud tone and
everything that he said might be heard from
every part of the yard I am acquainted
with all the legatees and they was all there except
Thomas J Minnis I do not recollect wither[sic] he
was there or not                 }

William Crawford sworn
    I was present at time of the sale
of Fan after making proclemation[sic] and
stating the Terms of the sale Turner the
crier proclaimed that he then offered
a fine likely h[e]arty hale looking
girl though her looks prove for her
self after a bid or two had been
made some person asked what kind
of a title would be given Turner replied
Just such a title the Executor was empo
ered to make When Samuel
Crawford remarked that the was no
dispute about the title that the title
was good that she never had been
known to have a days sickness
Turner did not warrant the soundness
of the negro.  I did not heare the first
word said about the warrantee
I full[feel] Very confident in the correctness
of what I have here Stated I was
within Ten or fifteen feet of the crier and
paid particular attention and am
satisfied that what I have said is
right.  The negro had gone up to about
Eight hundred dallars when the crier
came to a half - and at that time
Smith came up to where the sale
was going on at the time from
round the house from the direction
of the Kitchen and made way through
the crowd to the crier and told him
not to knock her off that he was not

silling[selling] a hourse of a cow.. I am under
the impression that I have heared all the
legatees time and again say that the
soundness of the negro was not warranted
at the sale I am very certain that
I have heared Samuel Crawford
Alfred Pickard & John O'Daniel
say so for I have talked more
with them upon the subject than
any other I know that these
last named person[s] speared[spared] no pains
in Hunting up witnesses having
them summoned and otherwise aiding

was obtained against Smith by false
swearing

I am well acquainted with the negro
woman Fan and saw her frequently
I think she was a healthy and sound
girl at the time of the sale I have no
Idie [idea] that any warrantee took place
