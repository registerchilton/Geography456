Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume G, page 392
Recorded Aug 1862

No witnesses, and no family members mentioned by name, and even the executor is anonymous, so the only name associated with this will is the testator's name.  Administrator's bond was $16,000.  All of this is quite unusual, but this will was probated during the war.

Also unusual: nearly 24 years between will being written and will probated which may account for the executor's name being blotted out.  It is possible that the estate sale and such occurred upon the demise of the testator's widow.

Estate Papers comprise 11 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Vickers, James (1862)".  This is mostly the inventory and estate sale. No family history found.
