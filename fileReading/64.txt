There are an unusually large number of omissions and errors in the will book version of this.   The original has bleed-through and is badly smeared so it is sometimes difficult to read. The will book copy should only be used to help read the original. Most notable are three items:
1) In the Will Book copy "Martha George" is listed as a grandson in the will book copy.
2) The original says "Matthew", and a line of names was omitted from the will book copy, but appeared in the original, i.e. "Williams Mason, Gustin Mason".
3) "Reany" is written "Beany" in the will book copy.

Estate Papers comprise 14 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Herndon, Mary (1844)".
