refund to them his rateable Proportion of such Debts & Demands so paid by your

it is.  May it please your Honour, that the Said Robert Murdock combining
and confederating himself with Others, / whose names when discovered Your
Orator pray may be inserted in this his bill with apt words charge them /
how to injure your Orators in the Premises, wholly refused to come to any
Account with your Orators touching the Premises or to refund to them his rateable

of Said William Mebane deceased, and if they or either of them did
So pay and discharge any such debts, that Amount So by them paid
was not so large as your Orators have set forth; A[t] Other times
he pretends that many unjust Claims against the Said estate
were admitted by the said James & Benjamin and much of the estate
wasted in expensive law-Suits, and that all this loss Should
be borne by he estates of the Said James & Benjamin; Whereas Your

James & Benjamin managed the estate of said William with diligent
Care and attention - They admit that much of the estate was
exhausted in defending it against Claim which they believed to be
unjust, but not more than was necessary to make such
defense.  Your Orator deny that the said James & Benjamin were
guilty of Collusion with pretended Claimants, or aided them in any
way in making unjust Recoveries, & they are advised that all
expenditures make by them in defend the estate against the
Claims Which were set up, ought in Justice Equity to be passed

/Vizt./ to his Wife Rebecca he gave one third part or share of the above schedule, he gave to his brother #
James one portion consisting of two third of the first three divisions as theretofore stated and to this brother
David the last portion or one third share remaining on the division with James And he gave to this

[Estate Papers - Deposition of R Stanford 13 Oct 1804]

Mr. Standford was[sic] you present at a settlement made
bitween William Mebane decd (in his life time) & myself
respecting a negro Wench Florah which is now["now" x-out] in suit
myself vz the Exrs of ["William" x-out] said Mebane now decease'd?

2d What was the conversation that past[sic] just before
or at the time of sd. settlemt. respecting the infirmity of
the Negro here in question ["did I not" x-out] between sd parties
did I not observe to Mr. Mebane that the wench had
turned out badly in as much that I believed she was useless [x-out]
[x-out] or an entire loss in consequence of a
Rheumatism which she then labour'd under?

3d What do you know respecting this wench's labor &c
under the aforesaid complaint or any other while the property of the Defend
=ant Will. Mebane Dec'd ? ---

4. What would you suppose the value of the Wench
to be at the time I purchased her of sd. Defendant?
or in other terms what would you [have] been[?] willing to
have given provided you had been about to purchase
her at the time she was purchased by myself?

5) What was the price at which we settled
for sd. Negro ?

6th did not Mr. Mebane propose her for sale frequently to you
and what was the reasons if any you felt no disposition
to purchase her

7th Did I not observe ["to you" x-out] and fully disclose [x-out] the
situation of the wench ["in Mr." x-out] to you in Mr. Mebane's
back Room to be irrecoverable & was afraid
[rest of question missing]

To Mr H. Thompson's questions in
the suit between himself, & the
Extors. of Wm Mebane Decd my answers
are as follow, Viz.

1. I was present at the settle-
ment, & believe that I witnessed
a note which sd. Thompson gave
the decd, as a balance, which then
remain'd due for a certain
negro wench called Flora

2. In the course of much
conversation upon sundry
items of Mr Thompson's
acct, & also respecting the wench
I well remember Mr. Thompson
[ink blot] observe (perhaps in objection
to interest on the Debt, which Mr
Mebane consider'd as just) that
Flora, or his bargain had turn'd
out very badly, & had been for little
or no service for a considera-
ble time, to which Mr. Mebane
replied, as well as I can recollect
the wench had had one spell
of sickness while he had her, & after
recovering from that was as

[page 2]
healthy as other wenches, or
perhaps [x-out] his other
negroes

3. I recollect nothing of her
labour, or ability to perform
labour, except that she was
sometimes made a house
wench, & some times worked
out, & know of no ["of" x-out] complaints
as to her performance, 'but
often heard Mr. Mebane explain
the aforesaid spell of sickness
which was perhaps a lingering
one.  He state the complaint
as being principally, & much
in her arms, & that he had
procur'd some decoction from
one of the nebors, which when
applied had appear'd to have the
effect of relieving her.

4. I consider myself a poor
judge of the value of any negro
& particularly of the wench in
question, never having inquired
into her age, or other generalities
& always being determin'd against

[page 3]
purchasing her, or, indeed, any other
under my then circumstances.
I did believe, however, if she was
worth purchasing at all, she
was worth the sum asked on
the terms proposed.

5. He often proposed her to me
as owning her husband, & at other
times wished to purchase her
husband, from me but I always evaded
the offer both ways, not in-
clining to either, for the ["my" x-out] rea-
son given in the fourth
answer, with the accompa=
nying impression that she
might be an unhealthy
or unsoun'd wench, which had
been suggested to me as probable
by a friend.

6. I believe Mr. Thompson
did disclose the situation of
the wench more than once
to me, & reject his purchase,
but whether on the road going
to Mr. Mebane's, & in his back
room I do not recollect,
perhaps [x-out] in both places

[page 4]
I know Mr. Thompson was restrain'd
["ed" erased] much in the course of the
settlement, & conversation upon
the subject, owing to the ["deli" erased]
then delicate situation of
the decd who was on his dying bed.

        Question by Mr Js.
Mebane, extor.

1. Does Mr Stanford believe
Mr. Thompson knew the wench
when he purchased her?

        Answer

    I do not know or believe
that he did, or did not but
suppose Mr. Mebane the decd proposed
her to him (Mr. Thompson) in
the same way that he did
to me.

Standford, knowledge of the case

William was yearly to receive and take to his own use one Seventh part of the Crop, that should be annually
made for the said William, and the said William in consideration thereof agreed with your Orator

known that he considered his said property under the following description (Viz) Slaves by the names of

                                                                                                      stock

[page 2]

He gave to his Brother James one portion consisting of two thirds of the first three divisions, as theretofore
Stated, and to his Brother David the last portion or one third share remaining on the division with James
And he gave to your Orator one full third share to him and his heirs forever. And at the decease or ---
Marriage of his said wife, he gave to your Orator all his Land and Manor plantation containing
between five & six hundred acres to him and his heirs subject nevertheless to the following Conditions
(Viz) your Orator would live with the Testator during the Term of his natural life and to take care of
him and his property all the while, and he appointed his Brother James Mebane & his father in law
the said Benjamin Rainey Executors of his said Will, which said Will soon after the said Testators
death was duly proved in the County Court of Pleas and Quarter Session for Orange aforesaid, and the said James
Mebane & Benjamin Rainey qualified thereto and took on themselves the burthen of the Execution thereof, as by the
said Will and probate may more fully appear.  And by virtue thereof or otherwise possessed themselves, of all
the said Slaves Stock Furniture, Tools, Books, and personal Estate, and of others his Slaves and ought to
have transferred and delivered to your Orator one full equal third part, of all the said Slaves, Stock
furniture Tools & Books so Contracted to be his at the death of the said William aforesaid - That soon
after the Testators death, the widow the said Rebecca dissented to his said Will and claimed her share of his
Estate agreeably to Law and afterwards married one John King -- That in or about October 1803
your Orator received of the said Executors two of the said Slaves so Scheduled Daniel & Grace and has not
received any other part of the personal Estate of the said William included in the said Contract -- That in
the said year 1802 and until he went to live with the said William under the Contract aforesaid he had
lived with his father Andrew Murdock Esquire, and had raised and made that year forty Barrels
of Corn or thereabouts to his own use which was at his fathers, and the said William after your Orator
went to live with him leave to make use of his the said Williams Corn in his Cribb for such distillation
on Condition your Orator replaced the same with his own Corn, and your Orator accordingly used some
of such Corn, and with forty Bushels of Rye which he had bought on his own account distilled
Whiskey of which the Hogshead herein after mentioned was part, and afterwards delivered the said
Williams the whole of the Corn, your Orator so possessed amounting to Forty Barrels or thereabouts, and
which your Orator believes replaced all that he had used of the said Williams and much more. And
the said Executors in or about 1805 brought an action of Trover[See Note 1] and Conversion in the County Court
of Pleas and Quarter Sessions for Orange aforesaid against your Orator for the value of the said Hogshead
of Whiskey, and a Verdict and Judgment was had therein, and an appeal Granted, And at the Term
of September 1810 in the Superior Court of Law for Orange aforesaid, the said Benjamin as Surviving Executor
of the said William (the said James Mebane the other Executor of the said William having died pending the
said action) recovered a Verdict and Judgment against your Orator for Sixty pound four shillings
and Eight pence, or thereabout Damages besides Costs of Suit, for the said Hogshead containing 140
Gallons of thereabout -- That your Orator having had liberty to distill Whiskey out of the Corn of the said late
                                                                                            William

[page 3]
William on Condition he sho'd replace such Corn as aforesaid, and having distilled Whiskey accordingly and
much more than replaced said Corn, and having used the Rye aforesaid belonging to himself in such
distillation ought in Justice and Equity either to have had and retained such whiskey to his own proper
use, or have an allowance for the Corn and grain he so replaced and used as aforesaid. And the said
Hogshead having been adjudged to belong to the said late William or his Estate, and the value thereof
with Interest recovered for the same your Orator is advised and insists that he is become entitled
to an allowance for his Corn and grain replaced and used as aforesaid and Interest which in his
Judgment will exceed the said Sum so recovered, and Create a balance in favor of your Orator
That your Orator will hoped that the said Executors in the life time of the said James Mebane
would have permitted him to enjoy the said Hogshead of Whiskey to his own use, and would will &
truly executed the Contract aforesaid on the part of the said William & his Executors to be performed
and transfer and deliver to him one full and equal third part, or share of the said Slaves and of
the other perishable property so described or scheduled as aforesaid as in Justice & Equity they ought
to have done --- But now so it is may it please your Honor that the said Benjamin
Rainey of Orange aforesaid combining and confederating to and with divers other persons unknown
to your Orator whose names where discovered he prays may be herein inserted and they made
parties with apt matter and words to charge them as Defendants and contriving how to injure
and defraud your Orator in the premises he the said Benjamin hath refused such permission
and hath recovered the value of the said Whiskey without making such allowance as aforesaid
and he and the said James Mebane deceased in his lifetime have and the said Benjamin
since his decease hath hitherto refused to transfer and deliver to your Orator any further or other
share of the said Slaves Stock, Furniture, Tools, and Books so described or scheduled as aforesaid
than the two Slaves, and the Bible and History aforesaid, and before they delivered the said Slaves
Compelled your Orator to pay or secure thirty three dollars and one third by way of making the other shares
equal and which he hath accordingly paid, and to give Bond and Security to refund in case of
["other" x-out] debts afterwards appearing which your Orator accordingly did He the said Benjamin some
times pretending that your Orator is not entitled to any such allowance Whereas your Orator charges
the Contrary to be true, and that if your Orator is not to have and retain the said Whiskey with=
=out paying the value that then he is in justice and Equity entitled to the said allowance
and your Orator charges that the said Benjamin hath acknowledged that such allowance would
over balance the said Whiskey and at other times he pretends that your Orator is entitled only to
a third share of the said Slaves Stock, Furniture, Tools, & Books under the said Will and not by force
of the Contract aforesaid, and that sundries of the said Slaves have been recovered by Judgment
against the said Executors by divers persons who claimed them by parol Gifts made or pretended
to be made by the said William in his life time before his Contract aforesaid with your Orator and
that the rest of the Testators personal Estate hath been exhausted in payment of debts damages
costs charges expenses and legacies whereas your Orator charges and insists that he is entitled
to the same third under and by force of the contract aforesaid, and that the said Will tends in some
degree to shew and confirm the said Contract, and does not destroy the validity thereof and that
                                                                                          your

[page 4]
Your Orator is entitled to receive his full third of the Schedule aforesaid or the value thereof before the pay=
=ment or delivery of any legacy, or Legacies, And that if Sundry of the said Slaves have been so recovered
(which your Orator doth not admit) yet that the same hath happened as your Orator believes for want of
proper Pleas or full and fair defense or by or through the negligence mismanagement or fraud of the said
Executors in or about making such defense and that your Orator is entitled to have any deficiency that may
["appear" x-out] happen in consequence of prior encumbrances made good to him out of the other Estate, And that
for £853.10.6 or thereabouts and that the Testator was not much Indebted at his death, and that
they permitted large Damages and Costs to be recovered against them /as your Orator believes/ by improper
Pleas and defenses or by neglect mismanagement or fraud in making the same, and particularly one
Alexander Mebane a Son of the said James Mebane the Executor was suffered to recover or receive large
Damages and Costs from the said Executor for a Slave named Luce by pretense of a Deed of Gift when
the Testator himself had ten or fifteen years before his death sold the same to one ________ Long
and your Orator charges that the said Executors have delivered over to several Legatees named in the said
Will Slaves which were the property of the said Testator at his death in satisfaction of several Legacies
given in the said Will and which your Orator believes would be sufficient to have made good your
Orators share due him by the said contract aforesaid and your Orator also charges that the balance
of your Orator's share remaining due to him by force of the said Contract and the Corn so replaced
and the Rye of your Orator so used as aforesaid are more and much more than sufficient to pay
the said Judgment for the whiskey aforesaid and that after such payment there will be in
your Orator's Estimation a very large balance due to him from the said Benjamin
as Surviving Executor as aforesaid And your Orator charges that the said Executors had notice of the Contract
aforesaid and in the life time of the late ["said" x-out] William as your Orator believes All which actings & pretenses are
Contrary to Equity and good conscience and tend to the manifest wrong of your Orator in the premises

In tender Consideration whereof and for as much as your Orator is remediless at Law
and cannot obtain adequate relief without the aid of a Court of Equity where matters of this nature
are properly Cognizable and releiable[?] To the end therefore that the said Benjamin Rainey may
upon his Corporal Oath full true and direct Answer make to all and singular the premises and
that as fully as if the same were here repeated and he thereunto interrogated And that the
said Benjamin may be decreed specifically to execute the said Contract, and to account for
transfer deliver and pay to your Orator his full third of the said Slaves, Stock Furniture
Tools & Books according to the Contract aforesaid, and that any deficiency in such share may be
be[sic] made good out of the other Shares aforesaid or orol[?] of the other Slaves and personal Estate
or that an allowance may be made your Orator for the said Corn and Rye so replaced and
used as aforesaid, and for the 33 1/3 dollars paid as aforesaid, and that an account may be
taken thereof, and that the said Benjamin may be perpetually Enjoined from all further and
other proceedings at Law upon or by virtue of the said Judgment or any Execution issued
                                                                                   or

[page 5]
[or] to be issued thereupon and that the said Bond to refund may be delivered up to be Canceled
or entirely vacated. And that your Orator may have such further and other relief in the premises
as the nature of his case may require and shall be agreeable to Equity and good conscience.
May it please your Honor not only to grant unto your Orator a Writ of Injunction to be issued
to be directed to the said Benjamin his Councilors Attorneys Agents and to the Clerk of the said
Superior Court, and to the Sheriff of said County of Orange, and to his Deputies &c thereby
Enjoining them from further proceeding at Law upon the said Judgment and any Execution
issued or to be issued thereon.  But also a Writ of Subpoena to be directed to the said Benjamin
thereby commanding him &c personally &c then and there true and perfect Answer make &c
and further to said to &c and your Orator shall every pray &c
