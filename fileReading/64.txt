Will of William Cain, Sr - 10 Apr 1856

     I William Cain of Orange County in North Carolina
do make this my last will & testament.

     In order to provide for the early payment of my debts & the
convenient division of my Estate, I will and devise all my lands
in Alabama & Tennessee, & my half of the House & ground in Hills-
-borough, which is held by Mr. John [U?] Kirkland & myself to be sold
in convenient time after my death & turned out & out into person-
-alty, and also my negroes in Alabama & all my crops on hand
or growing at my death, stocks, & all other personal Estate, where-
-soever situate, except my slaves in North Carolina; and I author-
-ise my Executors, or that one of them, who may act under my will,
to make said sales Sales & to convey to the purchaser or purchasers, and,
if necessary, I require my heirs at law to concur in such sales
of real Estate by joining in conveying the same, so as to aprove
the same effectually to the purchaser or purchasers. And, as
one of my executors may wish to purchase some of the land or
other things & it may conduce to enhance the price to allow him
to bid & purchase at public sale, I do order & direct, that my Exe-
-cutors may respectively do so, & that such purchases by open bid-
-ding at auction shall be valid, & proper conveyances shall be made
by the one executor to the other so purchasing, & if need be, by my
heirs at law.- If my Executors should die before making such
sales or refuse or fail to act under my will, I empower the
person or persons, to whom for the time being administration of
my personal estate may be committed in North Carolina, to
make or complete such sales & conveyances.

     Out of the proceeds of the sales aforesaid & all money on
hand or owing to me I order the charges of administration & my debts
to be paid in the first instance.

     The residue of the said proceeds of sale, money & debts & my
slaves in North Carolina & all other lands & other things & rights
belonging to me I give & divide amongst the different members
of my Family as follows: -
     The lands in Orange, on which I reside, containing about

[page 2]
nineteen hundred & fifty (1950) acres & all my Lots, houses & real estate in
Hillsborough (except that held my Mr. Kirkland & myself, & except those
hereinafter devised to Dr. Pride Jones). I give & devise to my son James F.
Cain in fee simple, and I also give him & his heirs all my right, legal
& equitable, in & to a certain house & grounds on the Oxford road east
of Hillsborough, formerly belonging to the late P. H. Mangum, for the pur-
-chase of which I lately contracted with Mr. Garret, and also twenty one
acres of land out of my tract adjoining, to be laid off so as to include
the peices[sic] I purchased from Mr. Cameron & Dr. Long containing about
thirteen acres & to include also eight acres more by a line running
from the corner of the said pieces next to the house in which I formerly
lived to the Oxford road. I am aware that the value of the said Real
Estates thus given to my son James somewhat exceeds nine thousand
dollars, yet, as he is my oldest son now living & I have hitherto made
but inconsiderable advancements to him, I think it best to estimate
it at that sum, and I accordingly direct that he be charged, in
respect thereof, with the sum of nine thousand dollars in the divisi
-on of my Estate hereinafter directed.

     To my son Thomas P. Cain I give in fee simple my Mills on
Little River in Orange County & the tract of land on which they are
situate, containing about six hundred acres, & also another
tract in Orange on which one Clements lives as a tenant, on the
Oxford road below my house & containing about one hundred and
forty acres; and also all my shares & interest of & in a certain
tract of land in Guilford County, called the Copper Mine, which I
hold with James Webb & others, and all other lands which I now
own in North Carolina legally or equitably & not herein speci-
fically disposed of: and for the same the said Thomas shall be
charged with the sum of five thousand dollars in the division of
my Estate.

     I have heretofore given to my daughter Minerva or her
husband Tod R. Caldwell Esquire in money & the slaves, Dennis
& his wife Fanny, George, Margaret & a boy named Cleg who
is a child of Haty, to the value of four thousand and four hundred
dollars, and I have given to my daughter Martha or her hus-
-band Dr. Pride Jones, in money & the slaves, Lizzy & Susan to

[page 3]
the value of five thousand dollars; and I do now confirm the said several
gifts & will that the said Tod R. Caldwell & Pride Jones respectively have
the issue of the said female slaves now born or that may be born, & shall be
respectively charged with the said several sums, in respect of those
prior gifts, in the division of my estate. And I furthermore give to
my son in law Pride Jones in fee simple, if he be living at my death,
& if he be then dead, to his wife Martha Ann in his stead the tract
of land near Hillsborough, which I purchased from David Yarbrough
& Miss Burke, containing about six hundred & thirty four acres,
(excepting thereout the eight acres thereof before given to my son
James) and also six town lots in Hillsborough lying between the
said land & Wm. Hill's, and I order that he or she, as the case may be,
shall be charged, in respect of the said land in this clause given, with
the sum of Nine thousand dollars in the division of my Estate.

     I have heretofore given to my son William, now deceased,
money & property of different kinds to the value of Six thousand
dollars, as I estimate it, which I mention as having a bearing
on the provision hereinafter made for his family.

    I have hitherto given to my grand daughter Mary Caldwell
a valuable negro girl, & I now give to my daughter Minerva Cald-
-well my Piano Forte, and to my daughter Mary C. her maid
Amy & a girl named Anna, a child of Sally, & to my son James F.
my female servant Maria - as special legacies, for the value of
which they are not to be accountable in the division. -

     I then give to my daughter Mary C. Cain out of the said
general fund the sum of Fifteen thousand dollars, payable with-
-in two years after my death; and I order that it be paid ["at all events" x-out]
["with" x-out ]without abatement with other pecuniary or general legacies, & at all
events, provided only that the fund be sufficient therefor after the
payment of charges & debts.

     I further give thereout to my son James F. Cain the sum of
Nine thousand dollars payable within two years after my death in
trust for the following purposes: that is to say : to invest the
same in the publick debt of North Carolina or in some other
secure manner, & to receive the interest or dividends accru-
-ing thereon & pay the same annually or oftener to Sarah, the

[page 4]
widow of my son William, during her widowhood & during the minority
of her son William, for the better support of herself & the nurture & educa
-tion of her two children; but upon the death or marriage of the said
Sarah during the minority of her said son or upon the coming of full
age of her said son, which shall first happen, the in trust for the
said two children, William & Elizabeth equally to be divided between
them. If one of my said two grand children should die unmarried and
under full age of twenty one years, then the share of him or her so
dying shall go to the other: provided nevertheless that the annual
profits shall, as before, be paid to the said Sarah, for the use of
herself & her surviving child, until her own [second "own" x-out] marriage or
the coming of age of the child. But if both of the said children, Willi-
-am & Elizabeth, should thus die unmarried & under full age, then
& in that case the whole fund, including both the original share
& the accrued share of the surviving child shall, apon the death of
such survivor, go to & be equally divided between such of my
children as may be then living, & if but one, then to that one; and
if I should have no child living at the said time, then & in that case
the said fund, including both shares, shall go to those persons who
at that time may be my next of kin according to the statute of
distributions & in the proportions therein prescribed. My reason
for these limitations over is principally, that upon the death of her
children during infancy the said Sarah would succeed by law to
what they derived from their father & might then [x-out] get
about one third of what I gave or intended to give to my son Willi
-am, namely, a child's part of my estate. And I express the hope,
that the provision I have thus made for my daughter in law & her
children will suffice for them, especially while the children are
young, so that their shares of their father's estate may accumu
-late & be ready to meet the larger expenses of advanced age &
education.

     I further will that, after the payment of charges, debts and
legacies aforesaid, there be made up in money or North Caro-
-lina slaves at valuation to each of my children Minerva,
Martha, James & Thomas, with what he or she both respectively
had or is charged with in this will as aforesaid the sum of Fifteen

[page 4]
Fifteen[sic] thousand dollars, so to make each of those four equal
with Mary, if there be a sufficiency for that purpose; and then the
residue of the fund, if any, to be equally divided among my
said five children now living.

     In making the division I order that Tom Green, the black-
-smith & Carpenter, be allotted to my son James at Eight hundred
dollars & Ellick at five hundred dollars; and that they boy Clay
be allotted to my son Thomas at three hundred & fifty dollars & the
boy Haywood at Eight hundred dollars; but these specific ap-
-propriations are not to take effect so as in any degree to defeat
the payment of the said legacy of Fifteen thousand dollars to my
daughter Mary.-  And I further will that in the said division
the children of my woman Maria belonging to me at my death
shall be allotted to my son James at a fair valuation in part
of his share of the general fund aforesaid, but if they should
happen to exceed his share, then he is to have them at all
counts specifically, as it is my intention not to separate any
part of Maria's family, but that James should have all of them  -
even if thereby Mary should lose part of her said pecunia-
ry legacy.

     About twenty years ago I sold to my sister Mary
my plantation on Eno & she has had possession of it ever since,
but I have never created a conveyance to her. I therefore
devise the same to her, my said sister, in fee simple.

     I direct that my negro woman Milly may choose her
owner amongst my five living children, & that he or she so
chosen shall take her at a fair valuation.

     I appoint my son James F. Cain & my son in law
Tod R. Caldwell the Executors of this my will, dated this 10th
day of April 1856 & with my signature on both sheets.
