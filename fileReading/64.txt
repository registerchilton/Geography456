He seems to make a distinction between his wife's children and his children.

No estate papers found for this testator.  There is a folder labeled "King, John (1801)" which contains 56 pages of papers for John King, died intestate in 1801, leaving widow Lavinia. William Bradford and William Ecoles were appointed administrators

The estate papers for John Bason are found here, too.  It isn't clear that all of these are related to the John King estates.
