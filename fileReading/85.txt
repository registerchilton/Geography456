Recorded Feb 1867

This is nearly word-for-word the same as the will of Elizabeth Latta - written in the same handwriting, same date.

Estate Papers comprise 28 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Latta, Amelia (1867)".  Thomas Lang was appointed administrator.  While "negroes" are mentioned in the will, the estate was probated after Emancipation, and no enslaved persons are mentioned in the estate papers.  The land was jointly owned by five sisters.  Her share was a one-fifth portion of the tract of approximately 150 acres, which when divided resulted in a 37 acre tract.
