Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume A, pages 231-232
Recorded Aug 1781

Loose will written on wide paper.  Text is very small, but clear handwriting typical of the era. The paper has absorbed the writing slightly, making some of it somewhat blurred. It might have gotten wet.

Note 1: The page is broken in two right in the middle of this list of text, obscuring a few words.  He's in the middle of revoking others, etc. and confirming this one to be his one and only, so neither names nor bequests are obscured. It would be good to compare to the will book copy, which seems to exist. The original has these two separated by a 1/4 inch margin.

On the second page of loose will the Ink has faded, and this entire page is very faint and hard to read.

Estate Papers comprise three pages and are found in folder labeled "Waggoner, George (1782)".  Executrix signature "Mary Kemp", so perhaps the widow remarried by the time of the inventory, Jul 1782.  No other family history found.
