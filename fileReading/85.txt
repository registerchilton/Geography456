Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume E, pages 293-294
Recorded May 1833

Note 1: This implies that he had seven children.  He had more than seven.  From this record it appears that he had 13 children.

This is just a list of seven of them.  Perhaps the older children were married or living independently at this point and had thus already received their inheritance?

Note 2: Margett is Margaret in the Will Book copy.

Note 3: In civil and property law, hotchpot (sometimes referred to as hotchpotch or the hotchpotch rule) is the blending, combining or offsetting of property (typically gifts) to ensure equality of a later division of property
