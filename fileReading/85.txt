North Carolina } Court of Equity
Orange County  } Fall Term 1849

        The above named case having
been referred to me by order of this Court
to make inquiry and report as to the valid
ity of the title of the land named in the pe
tition and the facts in relation to said ti
tle I beg leave respectfully to submit the
following report

    I find that the lands mentioned in the
petition were formerly the undistributed prop
erty of Jeremiah Holt - That the said
Jeremiah died intestate in said County
in and about the year 1814 that in the
partition of his lands among his Children
& heirs at law the land mentioned in
the petition were allotted to his daughter
Elisabeth B. Holt.  That about the year
1819 the said Elizabeth intermarried with
Peter L Ray and in the year 1820 she join
ed with yer husband the said Peter in
a deed of Conveyance of the aforesaid
lands to Peter Sharp from whom the pe
titioners Claim said land as his heirs at
law.  That the said Sharp went[?] into im
mediate possession and remained in pos
session of said land up to the period
of his death, claiming & hold the same
under the aforesaid deed That the privy
examination of the said Elisabeth was
taken to the aforesaid deed - That
the said Peter L Ray died in the year
1830 (Sepr.) leaving the said Elisabeth his widow

[page 2]
That she remained a femme sole from
that day up to the 3rd day of November
1832 a space of about one year when
she intermarried with John Turrentine
and that the sia Elisabeth and her husband
the said John Turrentine are both ????
living

    Upon the above state of fact I
am of opinion that the status of lim
itations commenced running against
the said Elizabeth upon the death of
her former husband P. L. Ray and that
having commenced running it did NOT
cease to run upon her intermarriage
with her present husband John S Tur
rentine and that the right of Entry
of the said Elisabeth upon said land
wad taken away at the expiration of
seven years from the death of the
said Roy That the said Elisabeth
hath now no title to said land but
that a good title to said land was
vested in the said Peter Sharp at the
time of his death and that conveyed
by the title of the purchaser David
Rich under the decree of this Court
at March Term 1848 will be good
and valid

    All of which is respectfully sub
mitted
               O. F. Long C & M E
