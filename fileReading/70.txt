Writing is light, faded and left margin is obscured by Conservator's Tape.  However, not hard to decipher.

Estate Papers redirect the researcher to the folder of "Kelly, John (1826)", which are more fully described with the will of John Kelly, Sr. (1817). Keziah Bain is mentioned in the will of her father, John Kelly, Sr. (1817), and this testator was one of the executors of his father-in-law's estate.
