Estate Papers comprise 89 pages and are found in the folder labeled "Freeland, Joseph (1843)".  This is a mix of estates, and only a few of these pages belong to this testator.  Many of the dates are before this testator died.  The majority of these refer to a testator named Joseph Freeland with John J. Freeland as executor and widow Lydia with children William, Thomas, Sarah and Mary Ann - which is a different estate for the will dated 1836.
