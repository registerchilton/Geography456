The testator's signature was written in a very shaky hand.  He described himself as weak in body and his handwriting supports that assertion.

Estate Papers comprise 46 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Parker, William H (1836)". Allotment of Dower to the widow Jane H. Parker is among these papers.
