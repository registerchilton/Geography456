Recorded Feb 1842

Note: Usage and spelling are unusual compared to other wills of the era. Handwriting uses letters that are indistinguishable from one another. Uses  a strange "r" when the word ends in "r" that does not return  to the baseline and resembles a superscript "e".  In most words the "b" is as expected, but always spells Abner as "ABner".  Upper case "D" also unusual and could be confused with L, S, or f.

Estate Papers comprise 321 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Roberts, Abner (1847)".  Testator died in May 1841.
