                        Pursuant to a Commission from
the Superior Court for the County of Orange to us direct
=ed, authorising & empowering us the subscribers two
acting Justices of the Peace in & for the County of Orange
to take the deposition of Samuel Turrentine to be
read & received as evidence in a certain matter of
Controversy for the plaintiff in a suit pending in sd.
Superior Court of Law wherein William Brooks
is plaintiff & Barnabas O'Farrill Admr. &c
is defendant - We have caused the said Saml.
Turrentine to come before us & after he being
duly sworn upon the Holy Evangelists of Almi
=ghty God, deposeth in the following words
Viz
         That some time after his appointment either as
Deputy or Sheriff for the County of Orange which of the
appointments he does not recollect, that sundry Executions,
came to his hand for collection against Thomas Brooks of
said County of Orange that he levied them on the Property of
said Thomas Brooks which consisted of several Negroes &
other Property that among them their[sic] was a negro boy about
15 or 16 years of age nam'd Tom which the said Thomas Brooks
told this deponent that he need not levy on that boy Tom
as he co[u]ld not be sold for his debts, that he give him
to his son Wm Brooks when a child, and that Wm
Brooks had, had him in possession for several years and
that the Damn'd rascal had run away and come back
this deponent proceeded to and did advertise a day of
sale pursuant to the above mentioned levy but the
Executors were satisfy'd and that on the day the said
sale was to have taken place Thomas Brooks

[page 2]
did offer to hire the said negro boy Tom; and that
the said Thomas Brooks did hire him for sundry years to
different Persons, sometime after that day.

Ques 1st by the defendant, do you not know during your acting
in your official capacity that Thomas Brooks was
in the habit of transferring his property from one to an other
of his family to evade the payment of his debts, and that
it was a mutual thing among them to retransfer when any
demands would come against them

Answer by deponent I do believe that such transactions did
take place between Thomas Brooks & his son Andrew
Brooks and I also believe That Thomas Brooks was in
the habit of giving his negroes to his family at one time and then taking
them back again at an other.

Quest. 2nd by Defendt. did not Thomas Brooks about the time
you levied on his Property or about the day of sale inform you that of a sale
must take place Tom the before mention'd negro boy
sho[u]ld be sold that he would bring nearer his
value than any Property he had

Answer by Deponent that was the understanding

Quest. 3thd. by Defendt, whas not that Proposal by Thomas
Brooks to sell Tom, made in consequence of a consulta
=tion among the family of said Thomas Brooks

Answer by Deponent I think it was and as he would
bring nearer his value than any of the rest and if he
was sold Wm. Brooks could be remunerated either by
giving him another or in some other way and he

[page 3]
further states that he does not recollect whether
Tom Brooks was one of the concil or not,

Quest. 4th by Defendt. did you ever hear Thomas Brooks
say he had sold Tom to his son Andrew

Answer by Deponent I don't recollect that I ever did
& further this deponent saithette[sic] not.

                                    of Andrew Brooks deceased.

Sheweth,

         That Andrew Brooks late of the Town of Hillsbo-
-rough & County aforesaid, deceased, being in his life time
and at the time of his death possessed of and entitled to a
considerable personal estate, consisting of negro slaves
live-stock & a variety of articles of the value of three
thousands Dollars or other other sum independent of
an improved Lot of which he was seized and possessed lying &
being in said Town of Hillsborough, did duly make
and publish his last will and Testament in writing
bearing date the 15th day of December A.D.1811, or thereabouts
and by & in the same, did will and bequeath (among other
things) to the effect following, that is to say -- "Fourthly,
" I give and bequeath unto my nephew James Brooks, son
" of my sister Hannah, one negro girl name Cate, daughter
" of Milley:- but as there is a suit now pending in Court

[page 2]

" against me for said negro girl, & that it is possible [that] I may
" lose her, in that case, I bequeath him one Hundred Dol-
" lars out of the balance of the sales of my House & Lot, my
" negro girl Jince & monies now due to me, as also the Money of
" the sale of my Cattle, if so much, should remain after pay-
" -ing my just debts and all expenses"

    " Sixthly I order that all my working tools shall remain
" for the use of my negro man Tom [orig: Thomas] during the life time of
" my Mother and Sister Hannah, that after their death, I be-
" queath the said tools to James Brooks my nephew."

    It is further shewn, that shortly after making & publishing
his said last Will and Testament the said Andrew Brooks
departed this life without altering or revoking the same: And
that the said Barnabas O'Farrel afterwards towit at ___ Term A.D. 1812 or thereabouts obtained
Letters of Administration with the Will annexed, to be grant-
ed to him, by this Court and possessed of himself of all the
personal estate belonging to his testator; and accounts due
to the estate: --- which said estate, including said debts and
accounts, your petitioner alleges, was considerably more
than sufficient to pay & satisfy all debts and demands
against the same, & that after such payment, there remains
in the hands of the said Barnabas, a large surplus yet
to be accounted for by him.

    You Petitioner further shews, that Betsey Brooks the Mo-
ther of the said Andrew, died some time in the year 1817 or thereabouts, and
that said Hannah Brooks mother of your petitioner, de-
parted this life in the Fall of the year 1826: And that
in the aforementioned suit for the girl Cate said girl was
recovered of & from the said Barnabas as administrator, so
                                                     that

[page 3]
your petitioner thereupon became entitled to the aforesaid
legacy of $100: and the said Betsey Brooks & Hannah Brooks
having both departed this life, your petitioner is also en-
titled to the set of Carpenters Tools which the said ne-
-gro man Tom was to use so long as the mother of the said
Andrew & his sister Hannah should live.

    The said Barnabas O'Farrel, having thus possessed
himself of the personal estate, your petitioner well hoped
would have come to a just & fair account touching the
same, & that the legacies aforesaid would have been passed[?]
over to him long before this: But your petitioner shews
that the said Barnabas, hath not even yet return to
this Court, any account to show, what estate of the said
Andrew, came to his hands, how he has administered and disposed of the
Same nor what debts & demands against the estate he has
paid off & discharged; And under various false and
inconsistent pretences hath refused, & still doth refuse
to pay to your petitioner, his said legacies or any part
thereof, although after requested so to do: which actings &
doing of the said Barnabas are highly wrongful & injuri-
-ous to your petitioner and against Equity & conscience.

    To the end therefore that the said Barnabas may full, true
and perfect answer Make to all & singular the premises and set
forth particularly what estate & debts came t his hands, and how
he has administered the same, and that may come to a fair
and just account with your petitioner, and be compelled
by a decree of this worshipful Court pay to you petition-
-er what may be due & owing to him on[?] the premises; and that
your Petitioner may have such other and further relief, as to your
worships shall seem meet, May it please your worships
to grant to your petitioner the State's Writ of Subpoena

him &c: to be & appear at the next Term of this Court &c.

                    of the Slave Tom for whom this suit is
brought as the Administrator of the estate of Andrew Brooks
deceased, and has been informed and believes that the plaintiffs
claim is founded in a pretense that the said Tom was
given to him, by parol[e], many years ago; the Defendant
therefore has met with much difficulty in acquiring
correct information on the suit.  He has been informed
and believes that Richard G. Owen is a material witness
for him in this suit, that his widow will shew that
the title of the slave is not in the plaintiff.  The said
Richard G. Owen had removed himself from this state,
to the state of Virginia at the time of the issue was joined
in this suit, and to what part of that state the Defendant
was ignorant, notwithstanding he diligently inquired for
the said Owen, until two or three months ago when
he learned that the said Owen lived with in the
County of Patrick or Henry since which information
to wit, in the beginning of August he sent a man with
notices to be served on the plaintiff to take the Deposition
of the said Owen, but the plaintiff, as Defendant was
informed by his messenger, was then on a journey to
the mountains and would not return for the space of
