There seems to be some missing material - perhaps a page?  It is also possible that the scribe left out a portion, or lost their train of thought?  The passage in question is this:

...that I may [page turn] death with the exception of one Bed
& furniture...

The original has a page turn, but the will book copy just goes from one word to the next as this occurs in the middle of a page.

No estate papers found.
