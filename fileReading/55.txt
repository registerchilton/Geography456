Estate Papers comprise 32 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Coble, John (1844)" These are for a different John Coble who died intestate, wife Elizabeth (this testator's wife is Catherine).  A portion of the account of the estate sale is a list of "The sawing accts on Book" with 17 entries, perhaps indicating that the testator was involved in a saw mill."John Coble late of sid. County departed this life intestate about the 10th of July 1844", so he died shortly before this will was written.
