Estate Papers comprise five pages and are found in a folder labeled "Cate, Benjamin (1811)".  This is the closest match, but does not seem to correlate well with this testator's estate.  In addition to the above transcription, there is a page of accounts "exhibited by Milley Cate Guardian" for the same slaves in 1811-1817, minus Ned who died in 1808 as noted.
