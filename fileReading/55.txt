[Estate Papers - Petition  Aug 1815]

North Carolina   }  Court of Pleas & Quarter Sessions
  Orange County  } August Term A.D. 1815

        To the Worshipful the Justices of the Pleas and
        Quarter Sessions.

            The Amended Petition of Asael Moore, in his
own right and as administrator of Elizabeth Moore, deceased,
against Daniel Turrentine surviving executor of the last will
and testament of John Moore deceased, and John Moore and David
Robeson, administrator of James Moore deceased who qualified with
the said Daniel Turrentine as coexecutor of the said last will
and testament --

        Humbly sheweth unto your worships, your Petitioners
Asael Moore, That John Moore late of the County of Orange de-
-ceased being in his life time , and at the time of his death possessed
of or entitled to a considerable personal estate, consisting of a great
variety of articles to the value of two thousand pounds or other large
sum, did duly make and publish his last will and testament
in writing bearing date the 24th day of October AD 1793 or
thereabouts, and by and in the same did devise and bequeath to
the effect following, among other things that is to say "I give to my
dear and loving wife for the term of her life, this house wherein I
now dwell with all the furniture and one third of the land a-
-bout it during her life; and after her death to my only Son Asahel,
and my young bay mare also with one third of the cattle. I give
to my son Asahel the plantation whereon I now live, With an obliga-
-tion for 900 acres of Land lying in Cumberland, and a young bay
mare two years old against Spring, and also one third of the Cattle,

[page 2]
Lastly I give to my Daughter Elisabeth a mare and Saddle, a bed and
furniture with one third of the Cattle, and fifty pounds in money, the
remainder of my money that is in my house and what is due I devise
to be put to interest in good hands, and to be equally divided between
my son and daughter" - and therein also appoint James Moore and
Daniel Turrentine executors thereof: And your petitioner further
sheweth unto your worships, that shortly after making said last
will and testament, the said John Moore departed this life without
altering or revoking the same: and the said James Moore and
Daniel Turrentine proved the same in the Court of Pleas and
Quarter Sessions of Orange County aforesaid and jointly undertook
the execution thereof, as will more fully appear, relation being
had to the said will and probate, and possessed themselves
of all the personal estate of the said John Moore deceased.

It is further shewn to your worships that some years after quali-
fying as executor in manner aforesaid the said James Moore, coex-
-ecutor as aforesaid removed himself and family from this State
unto the State of Tennessee where he shortly afterwards died in-
-testate & Tat the above-mentioned John Moore and David Robeson
now residing in the State of Tennessee, obtained letters of administra-
-tion of his personal estate to be granted to them, whereby they became
entitled and liable to sue and be sued as administrators of the
said intestate.  Your Petitioner further sheweth unto your worships
that Elizabeth Moore the daughter of the testator mentioned in
the said will some time ago departed this life intestate, under the
age of twenty one years, without issue, and without having received
her said legacy or any part thereof: That your petitioner hath
obtained letters of administration of her personal estate to be granted
to him by and out of the County Court of Orange County aforesaid
whereby he hath become entitled to all her interest in her said leg-
-acy.  And your petitioner further sheweth that whilst he was a minor

[page 3]
and under the age of twenty-one years, he and his sister the said Eliza-
-beth Moore deceased, oftentimes applied by their guardian to the said
John Moore deceased and Daniel Turrentine executors as aforesaid
for an account and settlement of the said estate: but they utterly re-
-fused so to do under various false, unjust and inconsistent sugges-
tions and pretenses: That since your petitioner came of age and obtain-
-ed letters of administration to be granted to him of the personal estate
of the said Elizabeth Moore deceased, he hath oftentimes in his own
right and as administrator of the said Elizabeth deceased, applied
to the said Turrentine who is the surviving executor, and to the said
James Moore; and since his death, to the said John Moore and David
Robeson administrator of &ca for an account and settlement: but they
and each of them, under various and frivolous pretexts have
continue to refuse so to do: All which doings and actings are
contrary to equity and good conscience.

    In tender consideration whereof, and forasmuch as your petitioner
is remediless except by the aid of this worshipful Court, and to the end that
the said Turrentine, John Moore and David Robeson may be compelled
to make full and true answer to the premises on oath, and to account
with your petitioner for said personal estate, and pay over to him
what may be due him in his several capacities on the balances
of such account so be be taken, May it please your worships to
grant to your petitioner, the States Writ of Subpoena to be directed
to &c commanding &ca at &ca to abide by &ca according to the Course?
of the Court and the law of the State: And to grant to your petitioner
such other and further relief as his case may require

    And your petitioner as in duty bound will ever pray &ca

                            John Scott  Atto, for Petr
