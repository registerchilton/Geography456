No estate papers found.

The scribe uses the conventions for handwritten lower-case "o" often when the letter should be an "a".  Inconsistent within their own writing such names a Steven (stevan, stevn, stevin, stevn) and Patsy (patsay, patsy, patsey, patssey).  Despite these features, the content is according to custom, so the handwriting is less challenging to decipher.

Note 1: Jutson/Judson is listed in the body of the will as a friend with no surname.  One of the witnesses is Judson Riley.
