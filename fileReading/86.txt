Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume D, pages 83-84
Recorded Nov 1802

No estate papers found.

Extremely precise, written in calligraphy..
Spellings for the most part quite modern.
Uses letter thorn, but for the word "the" only, rendered here as "ye".
There are several written "the", and it isn't used elsewhere for the same sound, such as the word "this", etc.
