no estate papers found.  The best match is a folder labeled "Clapp, Judy (1845) also see Polly Clapp c 1845" and comprises 13 pages with Emanuel Clapp as administrator on 26 Aug 1845.  Some reports are signed by John Trolinger who was appointed administrator on 25 Nov 1846.  No family history found and no solid connection to this testator.

In Polly Clark's 17 pages of Estate Papers, there is a petition to sell the slave by the name of Sam, so that his value can be divided among Polly's legatees. Sam was sold by Emanuel Clapp to John Law on 26 Sep 1845 for $502.00
