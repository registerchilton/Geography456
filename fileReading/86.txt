Estate Papers comprise 75 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Patton, John (1849)".  Although there is 11 years between the time the will was proved and the date of this folder, it appears that most of the estate papers pertain to the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of a testator named "John Patton".  By the time of some of the proceedings, the legatees were living in other locales so a number of the pages pertain to the assignment of power of attorney for legal representation in Orange County.  The transcriptions included here are not an exhaustive account of the family history.
