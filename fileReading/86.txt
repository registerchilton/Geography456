Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume D, pages 189-190
Recorded Feb 1807

The original will is roughly written, and uses unusual spellings. Names with their apparent numerous variations are the most difficult to interpret.  The will book copy does shed some light this will, but it is also not well copied.

No estate papers found.
