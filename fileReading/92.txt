Dear Brother.  I once more take my pen in hand
to let you know that I am well at this time hoping
these few line may safely reach and find you and
all the rest well.,  I have no new s to write at this time
every thing is quiet about here, though I dont know
how long it will remain So for they are expecting
a big fight here though I am in hope it would
be for I am tired of this war and I think that
evry[sic] body ought to be for I think that we have had
enough of men kil[l]ed allready though I am[?]
in hope I will live to See the end of it though I
may not and if I Should hap[p]en with the mis-
fortune not to get back I want Mother to
have my land and evry think else of mine
d[u]ring her lifetime and if Darius Should
live to get back I want him to have it at mothers
death and if he should have the misfortune
to not get back I want you to have it thought
I hope and trust to God that we all will
live to get back to our home and friends before
long and there is Spend the remainder
of our days in peace So I will bring these
few lines to a close by Saying I hope to hear
from you Soon no more only remain your
