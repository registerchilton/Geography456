Additional Comments:
No will book copy found.

Green was four years old when the will was written at the end of 1835, thus likely born in 1832

Jediah Smith in the will is written as Jedediah Smith in the estate papers.

There is only one witness, and because of this, it was only proved for personal property. It was not sufficient to pass on the land to the intended legatees.  For this reason, a jury was convened and they laid off the dower lands prescribed by law, and the remainder of the land was divided to the will's legatees per intestate law.

Estate Papers comprise 35 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Clark, Peter S (1839)". These papers explain some of the unusual features of this will.  It appears that the testator was not really sure that his personal property would pay all of his debts.  It did not, and suit was brought by his creditor (and executor) to force the legatees to sell the land that they inherited to pay the testator's debts.  The "negro boy Nelson" was seized and held by Jesse Durham in March of 1840.  Jesse Durham had married the testator's widow Susanna.
