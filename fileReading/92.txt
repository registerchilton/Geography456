Additional Comments:
Not found in Will Books, but the above Bill of Sale is found in Will Book Volume D, as noted.

Note 1: These phrases "Middle southward", "West End", etc. do not appear in close proximity or in line with other text, so it is unclear to what it refers...  Seems to be a reference to related to the land mentioned nearby in the text of the will, as a sort of accounting to keep track of what was bequeathed, but doesn't seem to join with any phrase nearby.

Note 2:  "W______ Cozart (widow)": the widow of the testator was "Winifred Cozart", but in these estate papers only the first initial is included.

Note 3: nugatory: Of little or no importance; trifling.

Estate Papers comprise 195 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Cozart, Anthony (1817)"

competent and credible witnesses, You Orators

continually kept the said Will in his possession
until within a very short time of his death, and

devises and bequests contained in the said last
will and testament; that your Orators' late
Father ["gradually" x-out] languished for a consi=
-derable time previous to his death under in
-creasing debility ["and the weight of years" x-out] his

divided after his death according to the dis=
-position contained in the said last Will,
that your Orators' late Father departed this
life in the Month of January in the year On
thousand Eight hundred and seventeen; that

You Orators further shew that you Orators
last Father departed this life in a few days

[page 3]

afterwards without altering, revoking or can=
-celling the said Will ["previous to death" x-out] Your Orators further shew
that the devises and bequests contained in the said
Will, excited much displeasure amongst some of
the legatees, which was expressed by indecent murmurs
and reproaches, that the said ["very" x-out] legatees that evinced
refactory dispositions had free access to the va=
=luables of the said deceased, the said chest being
without a lock to secure its contents.  Your Orators

shew that the said Will was in existence at the
time of the death of Your Orator' late Father, that
a surreptitious removal of the said Will with=
-out discovery was impracticable during the
period that intervened between the inspection of
the said Will by Your Orators Fathers as stated

were constantly present in the same room with the
said Chest, watching the last hours of the deceased

    You Orators well hoped that the defendants
in this suit, towit Agnes Brinkley, James Cozart
Prosser Horton and his wife Sarah, Noland
Hampton and his Wife Winifred, Mary Hicks Isaiah
Davis and his Wife Jemimah, W. Cozart or some
or one of them, would have disclosed the said will
and brought it in the County Court of Orange and
offered it for probate, and had it duly filed

[page 4]
                    4
in the Clerks office, as in conscience and Equity
they ought to have done, But Now so it is
May it please your Honor, that the said
Agnes Brinkley, James Cozart, Prosser Horton &
his wife Sarah, Noland Hampton and his wife
Winnifred, Mary Hicks, Isaiah Davis and his
Wife Jemimah, and W_____ Cozart combining and
confederating together, to and with divers other
persons as yet unknown to your Orators (but
whose names when discovered, your Orators
pray may be inserted herein, as defendants &
parties to this your Orators' suit, with proper &
sufficient words to charge them with the pre-
-mises) in order to oppress and injure your
Orators do ["absolutely" x-out] wholly neglect ["and" x-out]
to produce the said Will, and offer it for
probate in the County Court, or so to secure it and
safely deposite it, that the devises and legatees
in the said Will may obtain the benefit, of the
dispositions, devises and bequests contained
in the same.  For reason whereof the said Confe=
-derates sometimes alledge and pretend that
the testator made no such Will, nor any other
Will to the effect aforesaid, and at other times
they admit that the said testator made such
will, but then they pretend that the said testator
cancelled and destroyed the said Will; at other
times they pretend that the testator became
dissatisfied with the devises and bequeath con-
-tained in the said Will, and therefore directed
the confederates or some of them to destroy
and cancel the said Will in the testator life
-time, at other times they admit that the testator
made such Will, but pretend that the testator

[page 5]
                       5
revoked the same according to law; at other
time they admit that such Will may be in
existence, but then they pretend that it was mislaid
or entirely last in the lifetime of the testator whereby the provisions of the same
have become nugatory[See Note 3]; at other times they admin
[???] that the said Will is within their knowledge and
power, but pretend that the illegality, of the
execution and publications of the same dis-
-charges them from all obligation to dis-
-cover it.  At other times they admit that they
have the said will within their knowledge and command
but then they urge that the testator manifested
such disinclination that the will should stand
as was equivalent to a revocation of the same
or at lest such, as binds them in conscience
to suppress the will.  Whereas you Orators
charge the truth to be, that the said testator
died in January in the year One thousand
Eight hundred and seventeen, seized possessed of
and interested in, considerable real and
personal Estate, that your Orators' father
the said Testator when of sound mind and
disposing memory, did duly make and publish the
said Will; that the said Testator did depart this
life without altering, cancelling or revoking the
same, that the testator a few days previous to his
death did express full satisfaction in the devises
and bequests of the said Will, that the said
Will thereafter was continually within the power
of the defendants or some of them, and Your
Orators further charge that the said Will
did continue to be after the death of the testator
and now is in the possess=
-sion of the ["defendants" x-out] confederates or some of them, that the
["defendants" x-out] confederates have wholly neglected and refused

[page 6]
                       6
to bring the said Will into Court and offer
it for probate that the confederates do refuse
to make partition and division of the Estate
of the said testator agreeable to ["the" x-out] his Will
All which actings, pretences, and doings of
the said Confederated are contrary to Equity
and good Conscience, and tent to the ma=
-nifest injury and oppression of your Orators

    In tender consideration whereof, and for
that your Orators are remediless in the premises
by the strict rules of the Common Law, and re=
-lievable only in a Court of Equity, where mat-
-ters of this sort are properly cognizable,

    To the end therefore that the said confederates
may respectively full true direct and perfect ans-
swer make upon their respective corporal oaths
according to the best of their respective knowledge
information and belief to all and singular the
charges and matters aforesaid, as fully in every
respect as if the same were here again repeated

Anthony is, in whose hands, or in what place
whether the said Anthony Cozart did not
have a will when he died, and what hands
was the will deposited in before his death, or
after his death; Whether the said will was not
destroyed before or after the death of the testator
voluntarily, or removed surreptitiously by the
confederates, or some them, or one of them
or by some others, or some other, whose names
are yet unknown to your Orators; whether
the said Will was not cancelled, destroyed
or removed before or after the death of Your
Orators' father, by an extorted assent given
in the testators life time; whether the confede=

to the said Will, either upon their own know

whether the said Confederate, or one, and
which of them [x-out] refused & neglected to bring the said

[Estate Papers - Complaint (undated)]

To the Worshipful the Justices of the Court of Pleas & Quarter Sessions
of the County of Orange

               Humbly complaining shew unto your Worships your
Petitioners Nolen Hampton and Winnifred his wife of the
County of Orange - Isaiah David and Jemima his Wife of
the same, Agga Brinkley widow of William Brinkly late
of the same, and Mary Hicks widow of Daniel Hicks
late of the same.
               That Anthony Cozort late of the same County
on the _____ day of ____ in the year ______
or thereabouts died Intestate leaving James Cozort, William
Cozort, Robert Cozort all of the County aforesaid, Sarah Horton
wife of Prosser Horton of the County of __________ in Georgia
and your Petitioners, Winnifred Hampton, Jemima Davis
Agga Brinkley and Mary Hicks his children and only
heirs at Law. At the said time of the death of the said
Anthony Cozort deceased said Anthony was seized &
possessed of a large real Estate consisting of the following
tract of Land, that is to say, a tract lying on the east
side of Dial's Creek on this County aforesaid containing
640 acres or thereabouts adjoining Lands of Nathaniel
Carrington, Michael Carey, Benjamin Cozort and Abram
Parker, which said Land descended upon the Children
and heirs at Law aforesaid as tenants in common in fee
simple. Your Petitioners further shew unto your Worships
that the said Anthony Cozort had before his death advanced
the said James Cozort in lands by him to the said James
Cozort, before his said death giving to an amount equal to
the share or shares to which he the said James Cozort would
have been entitled as heir at Law of the said Anthony Cozort

    Your Petitioners further shew that they are desirous of
a division of the said Lands and had hoped that the same might
have been made without any adverse proceeding but now

[page 2]
so it is, that the said James, William & Robert Cozort &
the said Prosser Horton & Sarah his wife, although often thereunto
requested by your Petitioners, have hitherto refused and yet do
refuse either to divide the said lands by peaceable agreement [with your Petitioners] or
to Join with your Petitioners in a petition to your Worships
for that purpose. Pretending and giving out in speeches at some
times, that the said Anthony did not die intestate, but before
his said death, the said Anthony made and published his last
Will and Testament whereby he devised his said Lands to the
said Robert Cozort and William Cozort, and that said
Anthony died without revoking or altering said Will and
that at other times pretending, that, although the said Anthony
did die intestate as herein stated, yet that no advancements
were made as herein stated to the said James Cozort

Whereas your Petitioners charge and the said James, William &
Robert Cozort, and the said Prosser Horton and Sarah his
wife well know, that the said Anthony Cozort did die
Intestate as herein stated, and that if said Anthony
in his lifetime did make his last Will and Testament, which your
Petitioners charge is false, yet that the said Anthony before
his death did revoke and absolutely annul said Will, and
afterwards died without republishing the same, or making
any other Will, intestate, and whereas also your Petitioners
charge as the truth is, that the said James Cozort was
advanced in manner as herein before shewn

    To the End therefore that the said James, William and
Robert Cozort and the said Prosser Horton & Sarah his
Wife may upon oath true and perfect answer make
to all and Singular the premises, that the said Lands may
be divided by Commissioners to be appointed by your
Worships, among the said heirs at Law of the said Anthony,
and that the said James Cozort may bring into
                                     hotch pot

[page 3]
hotch pot[hodgepodge] the several advancements to him made, and set
forth a particular account of the same, or may abandon any
claim to any part of the said Lands, And that your Petitioners
may have such other and further relief as to your Worships,
the Circumstances of their Case may seem to require ----

    May it Please your Worships to grant you Petitioners
Writs of Subpoena directed to the said James, William,
Robert and Prosser Horton & wife respectively commanding
them to appear before your Worships on the fourth Monday
of May next at the Court House in Hillsborough, then & there
to answer the premises and to abide by and perform all
and singular the things which your Worships shall Order
and decree herein &c
               Your Petitioners shall ever Pray

[Estate Papers - Deposition 29 Aug 1820]
North Carolina }
Orange County  }
                  In pursuance of a commission
to us directed, to take the Deposition of Willie P.
Mangum at the store of Wm Cain in the Town
of Hillsborough in the 29th day of August 1820
to be read as evidence in a matter of controversy
now pending in the Superior Court of Law in & for
the state & County aforesaid wherein Noland Hampton
is plaintiff & Robert & William Cozart Admrs. of
Anthony Cozart decd. are defendants. We caused the
sd Willie P Mangum to appear before us at the
time & place aforesd. who being first duly sworn
deposeth & saith. That since six of seven years ago
not exceeding seven years ago
the precise time not accurately remembered - that Noland
Hampton the plaintiff in sd Suit rode with Deponent from
Flat River to Hillsboro. at which time Deponent was a
student at Law that sd, Hampton occupied a considerable
portion of the time in inquiries respecting differences which
at the time [? existed] between him and Anthony Cozart now
decd. Hampton stated that he had at that time purchased
either one or two negro slaves of sd. Anthony, that the Ne-
groes were unsound & that sd. Anthony had refused or was
unwilling to indemnify sd. Hampton, & sd. Hampton at that
period contemplated according to his conversation to institute
a suit against sd. Anthony Cozart to recover damages for
the fraud that he stated the sd. Anthony had practiced upon
him, the difficulty at the time of the Conversation, seemed
to be that sd. Hampton would be barred by the Statute
of Limitations - This the deponent remembers for that
inquiries were made whether conversation with & admissions by sd Anthony would
not prevent the operation of the status at

[page 2]
which time the Deponents ignorance of the Law, prevented
any satisfactory answer. -- The Deponent further
say that at that time sd. Hampton repeatedly stated
in substance that if he could not sustain a suit he should never
get any satisfaction. --

        At a subsequent period in 1815 or 1817 as well as he remembers Hampton came to
advise the Deponent touching some matter of Controversy
respecting the estate of sd. Anthony decd. - the deponent
told sd. Hampton that he could not hear his case
inasmuch as Robert Cozart had employed him in
the whole business as he understood -- Hampton however in presence
of Deponent, the Deponents father & perhaps others
persisted in his Complaints of the ill treatment of
sd. Anthony & his family, And amongst other things the
Deponent distinctly understood a principal griev-
-ance complained of - to be that he sd. Hampton had
paid for two sickly & diseased Negroes and sd.
Anthony had not made him any indemnity -- In
neither of which conversations did the deponent
according to the best of his recollection hear a
syllable importing that sd. Hampton had received
any indemnity whatsoever form sd. Anthony for the prices
paid for sd. Negroes. -- & this Deponent further
saith not.
