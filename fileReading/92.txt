Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume D, pages 205-206
Recorded May 1806 [See Note 2]

The word "Heirs" is written illegibly throughout the will, but seems to vary in spelling.

Note 1: "Ben & Cloe" are listed twice, once at the beginning and once at the end, however the stated total number of 15 is arrived at when "Ben & Cloe" are counted twice, so it appears this is not a repeat of the same persons.

Note 2: The wills before and after this one in the will book were proved Nov 1807.  The probate date for this will is clearly marked May 1806, hence recorded out of chronological order.

Estate Papers comprise 94 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Loftin, Joseph (1807)".

                                Humbly complaining sheweth unto your Honor,
Your Orators Morgan Yeargan and Catherine his wife, William Loftin an
Infant under the age of twenty one year by Benjamin Yeargan his Guardian,
Beneter Loftin an Infant under the age of twenty one year by Morgan Yeargan
her Guardian, and the said Morgan Yeargan Administrator of all and
singular the Good and chattels rights and credits of Elisabeth Loftin junr. deceased,
all of the County of Orange aforesaid, that Joseph Loftin late of the County of Orange,
was in his lifetime seized and possessed of a large Estate real and personal,
and being so seized and possessed of a large Estate real and personal, & being
so seized and possessed on the 27th day of March 1806; duly made & published
his last will and Testament in writing; and therein amongst other things
bequeath sundry articles of provisions to Elisabeth his wife, and to her
during her life four negro slaves; three Horses, a riding Chair and the
greater part of his household furniture, and having disposed of the greater
part of his real Estate, and several of his Slaves, devised and bequeath
in the following words, towit, 6th all the rest of my Estate I wish to be divided
"amongst all my children; all the negroes and their increase left to my wife,
"I want equally divided amongst my children, at her death; to them their
"heirs and assigns forever. 7th I wish the land in Craven County, that I
"bought of Thomas Heath, to be sold ath the discretion of my Executors, and
"the money arising from the Sale, to be equally divided amongst my children",
all o which will more fully and accuratly appear reference being had to the
said Will, to which your Orators beg leave to refer for greater certainty.
and the said Joseph Loftin afterwards, towit, in the month of April in this
same year, departed this life, without having in any manner changed,
or altered his said Will, whereupon Daniel West & Leonard Loftin the
Executor therein named cause the said Will to be duly proved at a
County Court of Pleas and Quarter Sessions held for the said County of
Orange on the fourth Monday of May in the same year, and took
on themselves the burthen of executing the same.

Your Orators further shew that the Defendants by virtue of their authority

[page 2]
as Executors of the said Will, immediately after the probate thereof, possessed themselves
of all the personal property of the Testator, as set forth in three[?] several returns herein
after mentioned, and also of fifteen slaves of the said Estate, towit, Ben. Cloe,
Jude junr., James, Will, Big Charles, Little Charles, Joe, Jude Senr. Mol, Joe, Sid, Harry,
Ben, & Cloe,[see Note 1] and soon afterword sold the perishable part of the said Estate, and
hired out the said Slaves; and also sold the tract of Land; devised to be sold
as aforesaid: and returned to the said Court of Orange County Inventaries and
accounts of Sale of the said property (to wit)  An Inventary and account of
Sales of the property of the Testator in Orange County, including Debts due to
the Testator, amounting to six hundred & six pounds two shillings & nine pence
a second Inventary of the Estate of the Testator, including debts and the Sale
of the said land, amounting to Two thousand six hundred & twenty one
pounds five shilling and three pence; And a third Inventary & amount
of Sales of the residue of the property of Testator in Orange, amounting to
Two thousand and ninety six pound ten shilling & six pence, to which
returns your Orator for greater certainty beg leave to refer; and your Orators
change that the Defendants, have received property and debts of the
said Estate to a great amount, which are not mentioned in the said
returns.  Your Orators further shew that Elisabeth the widow
of the Testator died intestate, in the month of July in the year aforesaid
before the Defendants had opurted[opportuned?] to the bequest to hir, and therefore
they have administered the property, willed to her as the property of
the Testator and have the proceeds thereof in their hands.

Your Orators further shew that the Defendants divided the Slaves
of the said Estate, subject to a division amongst the Legatees, and
upon such division the Complainants Catherine became a creditor
to the amount of £ 16.5.0; the complainant Beneter to the amount
of £ 3.15.9; and the Defendant Leonard became a Debtor To the
amount of £11.5.0' and the complainant William to the amount
of £8:15.0; which sums remain unsatisfied - - Your Orators further
shew that your Orator Morgan Yeargan purchased at the Sale
of the said Estate, sundry article for the price of which he executed
his Bond to the Defendant, and hath since been compelled to pay
the amount thereof, and that your said Orator became bound
with the Testator in his life time, as Security for the Testator, to one
James Webb Administrator of the Estate of George Moore in the final
Sum of One thousand ["dollars" x-out] Conditioned among other things
that the Testator would pay to the said James Webb thirty one
                                                            pounds

[page 3]
pound on the first day of January 1806 and the said James Webb
hath sued your said Orator on the said Bond and recovered
Judgment thereon; with five pounds eight & nine pence costs, which
said Judgment and costs your said Orator hath paid & discharged. --

Your Orators further shew that the Testator left living at the time of
his death five children towit, the Defendant Leonard and your Orators
William, Catherine, Beneter, & Elisabeth; and the said Elisabeth died
in July 1806 an Infant of tender years, and your Orator Morgan
obtained the administration of her goods and chattels right and
Credits, at a County Court of Pleas and Quarter Sessions held for
the said County on the fourth Monday of August 1808

    Your Orators well hoped that the Defendant would have
executed the Will of the Testator and concluded the Executorship
with diligence, prudence, and Integrity, and would have paid over to
your Orators their respective share of the said Estate, and the profits
thereof at the end of two years from the probate of the said Will.
But so it ["is may it please your Honor" x-out] that the Defendants combining
and confederating with others how to cheat and defraud your Orators
have wholly failed to pay over to your Orators their share of the said
Estate, although often thereof requested and give out in speeches that
that the whole of the said Estate hath been exhausted in the payment of debts
due form the Testator; whereas your Orators expressly charge that the Testator
was indebted in but a very small sum at the time of his death, part of
which your Orator Morgan Yeargan paid and at other times
they say that they have not collected the monies due to the Testator
in his lifetime, whereas you Orators charge that the Defendants have collected
the said monies, and have converted them to their own use, and made
great profit thereof, for that all the said Debtors were solvent and able
to pay.  And also that a valuable bay Horse of the price of $200 died
in the service of the Estate, and that a double chair of the value
of $75 was by inevitable accident broken and distroyed in the
service of the said Estate, whereas your Orators charge that the
Defendant Leonard used the said Horse on his own private busi
-ness, and killed the said Horse by riving in an umvartable[?]
and excessive manner, or by carelessness, or mismanagement of the
said Horse, and that he said Leonard used the said Chair on a

[page 4]
Journey upon his own business, and broke and distroyed the same by
his rashness and want of reasonable care.  All which actings
and doings are contrary to Equity and good conscience and tend
to the manifest injury of your Orators, In tender consideration
whereof, and for as much as your Orators are remediless in the premises
except in this Honorable Court.  To the end therefore that the Defendants
may full true and perfect answer make to the several matters & things
set forth and charged in this Bill in as full and ample manner
as if the same were herein again repeated and they therein interro
=gated; And that the Defendants may be compelled to set forth
and show, what property of the Testator hath come to their hands and
what debts are due to the Testator they have collected, and at what
times; to render a full and accurate account of the said Estate, &
the manner in which they have administered the same; that they
may be compelled to produce all the Books entries and papers
in their possession or power touching and concerning the said
Estate, that the Defendants may be compelled to account with your
Orators and pay over to them their respective shares of the said Estate,
and to your Orator Morgan Yeargan the money advanced by
him for the said Estate; and that your Orators may have such
other and further relief, as to your Honor may seem just &
Equitable, may it please your Honor to grant to your Orators
your Writ or Writs of Capias ad respondendum to hold the
Defendants to bail in the sum of Three thousand pounds, to be
issued to the County of Craven where the Defendants reside and
the Complainants will ever pray &c

      =ants maketh Oath that from a view of the several returns
      make by the Defendants, and his knowledge of the situation
      of the Estate of the Testator, he verily believes the complainants
      are intitled to recover of the Defendants one thousand

of the estate of his testator his accounts are of a length &
intricacy which render much time necessary to state them -
and he cannot prepare his account in time to answer at
the September term of Orange Court of Equity ~~
