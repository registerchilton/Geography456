Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume E, pages 42-46
Recorded Nov 1823

Surname Rowan or Roane - both are in the will and condicil.

The date on the original will was overwritten and is difficult to read.  Some researchers interpret this to be 1825, but it was probated in Nov 1823, so that isn't likely.

The Estate Papers comprise 81 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Holt, Isaac (1822)".  Manor Tract was 300 acres, divided between the testator's widow, Mary, receiving 100 acres, and Isaac, Jr who received 200 acres.  Extensive inventory, including the contents of a store? store house?  Sold 26 half-dozen spoons, so had an excess of 150 spoons, for example. Wide variety and large quantity of woodworking tools.  Over 30 sets of cups and saucers?
