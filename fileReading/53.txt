           To the Worshipful the Justice of the Court of Pleas
    and Quarter Session for Orange County,
                   The Petition of Clara Moore Widow &
                   relict of John Moore late of Orange County
                   Deceased, Also of David Moore and Jonathan
                   Moore, Children of Said Deceased -
                              Against
                   Ruffin Moore Charley Moore & Green Moore
                   Children of James Moore Deceased, And also
                   Against Susannah Moore, Widow & Relict of
                   Said Jones -

Humbly Sheweth,
                  that John Moore late of the County of Orange departed
this Life in or about the Year 1801, having previous published in
Writing his last Will, duly attested to pass his Real estates, which Since
his Death hath been proved in this Worshipful Court & Recorded -- That
in and by the Said Will, to which your Petitioners refer for greater
Certainty, the Testator devised the Tract of Land and Plantation on
which he lind[lent] to your Petitioner Clara Moore, and directed the
residue of his Lands to be rented out Until his youngest Child
Should arrive at age, when they were to be equally divided between
your Petitioner Clara, and her Children -- The Testator left the
following children, to Wit, James Moore William Moore, Jane
Since intermarried with Thomas Steele, David Moore & Jonathan
Moore, all Minors under the Age of twenty one Years --

        that the Testator died Seized of Sundry Tract of Land
all adjoining each other, Situate in Orange County & on Haw River and Colin's
Creek, and containing 468 Acres or thereabout , and the Tract
                                                        (on which

[page 2]
on which he lived and which he devised to you Petitioner
Clara, contain one hundred and fifty Acres or thereabouts --

        That your Petitioner Clara being anxious to
promote the Interest of her Children, Agreed in the Year 1809
to be content with a Child's Part of the Said Lands, and to have
the whole of the Lands aforesaid equally divided among her
Children and herself; And to carry this Agreement into effect,
(her sons James Moore and William Moore being then of full
age,) she employed Jonathan Lindly to Survey and make
Partition of the Said Lands; And the Said Jonathan on or about
7th September 1809 did Survey the said Lands,, and made Partition
thereof, marking out to Your Petitioner and to each of her
Children aforesaid a Lot, containing as he then supposed about
78 Acres -- That each took possession of the Lot So marked out
for ??? her , and hath occupied the Same - That Since the
Said Partition, William Moore and Thomas Steele and Jane Steele
his Wife, have Sold their Lots to James Moore; and the Said
James Moore hath lately died intestate, leaving Susannah Moore
his Widow, and the following Children, Ruffin, Charly, James & Green, all
Minors under the Age of twenty one Years, and James hath Since
died intestate and without Issue; So that the said Ruffin, Charley &
Green now hold by Descent three Lots marked out by the Said
Jonathan Lindly as aforesaid, in which Susannah their Mother is
entitled to Dower, which hath been duly assigned to her --

        That now, Jonathan the youngest Child of the Testator
John Moore hath arrived to full age, and it hath been discovered
that the Partition made by the Said Jonathan Lindly was defective
for the purposes intended by it, inasmuch as the Heirs & Devisees
                                                       ( of the

[page 3]
of the said Testator were not all of full age when the Said Partition
was made, and the minors had no guardian, and mutual Conveyances
in Severalty could not be made by the Said Tenants in Common - And
it hath also been discovered that the Said Partition was erroneous in
fact, and that the Lots marked out to your Petitioners Clara,
David and Jonathan do not contain as was intended, 78 Acres each.

        Your Petitioners further Shew that at the Time of the Said
Partition the Several Lots were valued, and the Lots of Superior Value
were charged with the Payment of Such Sums to the Lots of inferior
Value, as made the Dividends equal & the Payments have been made accordingly
They further shew that
they are content with the Said Partition in all things except as to the
Deficiency in Quantity in their respective Lots, which happened by ???
Mistake in the Said Lindly, and they do not wish to disturb the
general Allotment which hath been made, but to have the Said
Mistake corrected, and Such legal form given to the Partition of Said
Lands as will enable each Tenant to hold in Severalty and to make
out a legal title to his or her Lot -- And Your Petitioner Clara, for
the Consideration aforesaid and also for the further Consideration of
five Shillings to her in Hand paid, hath given, granted, bargained, Sold
and Released, & by these Presents doth give, grant, bargain, Sell & release
to her Children aforesaid all her Right, Title, Interest, Claim or
Demand in and to the Said Land, except So much thereof as may
be allotted to her as a Childs Part thereof -- And your Petitioners
David Moore and Jonathan Moore for the Consideration of five Shillings
to them in hand paid, have Released and by these Presents do Release to the
Executor of the last Will of the Testator Aforesaid, All Claim or
Demand for Rents, Species[?], or Profits of the Said Land heretofore Received
or which ought to have been received by them -----

            Your Petitioners further shew that Caleb Lindsay
hath been appointed by this Worshipful Court Guardian of
                                                        (the

[page 4]
the Aforesaid Ruffin, Charly and Greene Moore, -- And they pray
Your Worships to appoint five Freeholds to make Partition of
the Lands aforesaid Under the Order of his Worshipful Court,
observing? as far as the Same can be done, in effecting an equal
Division,the Partition made by he Said Jonathan Lindly: And
You Petitions will ever pray ---             her
     Witness                          Clara (X) Moore (seal)
