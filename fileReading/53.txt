Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume F, pages 402-403
Recorded Feb 1848

In both the loose will and in the will book copy, the writers make no distinction in the way they write both the I and the J, thus the testator's middle initial is unclear.

Estate Papers comprise 18 pages and are found in the folder labeled "Rountree, Harvey I (1848)".  This includes the account of the estate sale, recorded Feb 1848. In the May 1850 accounting of the estate, there is reference to slaves: "To valuation of negroes See certificate of Commrs   $2000.00".  This "Certificate of Commissioners" is found in these papers, as transcribed below - no further details found.  The back of the paper has a few random numbers and calculations on it, but they don't seem to be related to this document.
