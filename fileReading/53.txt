[page 2 different handwriting]
    The execution of a paper writing purporting
to be the last Will and testament of William A. Mc=
Kee was duly proved by the evidence of Joseph
McKee who proved that the paper was found among
the valuable papers and effects of William A
McKee on the day he was buried, & he proved
also that the said paper with the signature was
all in the hand writing of William A McKee
and it was further proved also to be in every
part in his hand writing by Charles Wilson and
William[?] H. Jordan

    It is therefore ordered and considered by the
court that the said paper is the last Will of William
A McKee & that the same be recorded as such--
