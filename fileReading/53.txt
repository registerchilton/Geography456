Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume B, pages 154-156
Recorded unknown date

No estate papers found.  There is a folder labeled "Love, Thomas (1816)".  The executors listed in this folder match, but the in this folder there is a reference to a widow, Mary who isn't mentioned in the will.   However other than the mention of a widow - possibly the testator's widow - there is not additional family history.

Another possibility is that the Peggy Love mentioned in the will (without mentioning the relationship to the testator) is the same person as the Mary Love (widow of Thomas Love) listed in the Estate papers.
