Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume D, pages 490-491
Recorded Aug 1816

Original loose will is very badly smeared, and some large ink blobs have flaked off. Despite the date of 1812, it is written in a style more like some 50 years prior.

Estate Papers comprise 16 pages and are found in a folder entitled "Cate, Thomas (1817)". Inventory is extensive including nine pages.  It is unusual to see slaves making estate sale purchases, though the purchase prices are rather modest.

Note 1: Kip skin: Leather prepared from the skin of young or small cattle, intermediate in grade between calfskin and cowhide.
