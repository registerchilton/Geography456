Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume D, page 478
Recorded May 1816

Consistently written "Handcock" throughout will, but signature, in different handwriting, written "James Hancock" - not simply an "X".

Estate Papers comprise seven pages and are found in the folder labeled "Hancock, James (1817)". Standley Hancock, orphan of James Hanockk owned a Negro boy slave 12 years old, unnamed, perhaps the "John" named in the will.  John Hancock owned a Negro woman & child, perhaps the woman Dinah mentioned in the will.  These are mentioned in this estate papers because John and Standley Hancock were minors and their slaves were being hired out.
