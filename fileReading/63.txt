Estate Papers comprise 231 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Smith, Stephen (1828)". Testator died in 1825.  Testator has entered into a co-partnership with Jacob Wagoner Junior.  In addition to the above slave inventories, which vary slightly from one another, another inventory lists: "Bill, Peggy, Lindsey, Charles, Rachael, Tom, Bess, George, Aaron & Rose".  A subsequent list crosses off "Bess" and inserts "Clary".  The main information is transcribed here, but if a researcher is focused on this lineage or the slaves, it would be wise to re-examine all of these estate papers.
