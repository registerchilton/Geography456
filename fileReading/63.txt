Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume F, pages 188-190
Recorded Feb 1844

Estate Papers comprise 36 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Pickett, John (1844)".  Estate sale occurred "2 Jan 1833" and lists Julian Pickett as purchaser of "negroe man Isaac   146.00".  This date is clearly written, but appears to be incorrect.  There is a petition to sell Isaac within these papers. This petition was dated Feb 1844. Dower was allotted to the testator's widow in 26 Mar 1844.

Within these papers is a request to appoint an administrator in the estate of a different John Pickett, wife Jane (whose brother's name is Samuel Hopkins).  This request is dated 21 Feb 1802, so obviously not the testator of this will who died over 40 years later and was married to Catharine at the time.
