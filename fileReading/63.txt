Recorded Feb 1831

Estate Papers comprise 16 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Bird, Empson (1831)".  Widow describes herself as "Mary Bird". Testator died "March last"? With the will being proved in February, March does not appear to be correct.  Some of these papers are the allotment of dower.  Includes inventory of notes, and account of sales. 1831 To Hire Hannah this year say for 8 months $5.00; 1832: $17.20, 1833: 15.05.
