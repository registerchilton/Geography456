Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume F, pages 93-94
Recorded Aug 1841

S. W. Fowler seems to have written this, and also the will of Sullivan Leigh (1843).  Many of the letter "o" appear to be "a", and this is possibly due to dialect and phonetic spellings?

Sullivan Fowler is listed as executor.  Is this the same person as Richard S. Fowler?

No estate papers found.
