Additional Comments:

Recorded Nov 1796

Both the original loose will and the will book copy feature unusual spellings, uncommon words, and poor penmanship.  These two transcriptions are expected to contain many errors, despite efforts to be accurate.

Note that will book copy sometimes has this surname as "Coble"

No estate papers found.  Also looked under Coble.
