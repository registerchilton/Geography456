Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume C, page 94
Recorded May 1797

The "rest & residue" of the estate was willed to John King.  The will book copy leaves off the name of the legatee

No estate papers found.  This is expected as the executor inherited the estate, so would not need to report what he did with it to the county.  The main legatee, John King, may be the same person who died intestate, father of Lavinia.  See Estate Papers for John King (1801)
