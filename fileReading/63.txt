ory do make, constitute, publish & declare this as my
last will & Testament in the manner and form following;
to wit Imprimis, I give & devise to my dearly beloved
wife Elizabeth Armstrong one third part of the tract
of Land whereon I now live, including the mansion
house, & necessary outhouses, but excluding the
barn, sheds annexed thereto, with the machines

board, two tables, & one case of drawers. ~~~

        My strong desire is, that my beloved wife & daughter Franc-
es may continue to live with my son Anderson at the
place of my present residence, & in that event, I enjoin
upon my said son to take upon himself the management
of the negroes hereinbefore bequeathed to my wife, together
with those hereinafter bequeathed to my daughter Frances, &
with the proceeds of their labour to furnish my said wife
& daughter with a comfortable support, the former during
her life time & the latter, till she shall marry or come to
the age of 21 years, when her negroes with all their in=
crease shall be delivered up to her. ~~ Should it howev=
er happen that they do not continue to live together,
then, it is my desire, that the aforesaid real & personal
estate be delivered by my Executors into the possession of my
said wife, together with two good farm horses, a suf=
                                        =ficiency

also kitchen furniture, & one year's provisions for her-
self, family & stock: & to my daughter Francis in
case of such separation, a good horse saddle & bridle

2ndly I give & devise to my son Anderson Armstrong all
the land now possessed by me in the County of Orange &
State of North Carolina, with the appurtenances, (except
that in which I have hereinbefore given to my wife a
life time estate, & in regard to that, I give & devise the
same to him after such life estate) to him & his heirs
forever: I further give & bequeath to my said Son Ander=
son the following negro slaves together with such increase
as they may have at my death; to wit, Black Phillis,
Davie, Bob, Thomas Washington, Robert Willie, Jerry Umstead,
Drusilla, Tenah, Levinia, Henry Jackson, Anderson,

my stock of every description, household & kitchen
furniture, farming tools &c (except in case of a separation
as aforesaid) one desk, one clock, & one watch, to him &
his heirs forever: I further give & bequeath to my said
son all notes, accounts & monies belonging to me, out of
which he is to pay all my just debts.~~~

3rdly I give & bequeath to my daughter Asenath Currie
& son-in-law John Currie, the following negro slaves,
together with such increase as they may have at my
death; to wit, Candice & her three children, Eliza &
her three children, & Maria & her two children, also one
man Lewis in special trust & confidence for their own
benefit & use till the death of my daughter Asenath;
at which time, said negroes with all their increase
are to be valued & divided between her children
& husband in the following manner, (to wit,) If she
should not have more than six children, her hus-
band John Currie is to receive one seventh part of

[page 3]
the abovementioned negroes during his natural life, & at his
death such part is to be equally divided among my said daugh=
ter's children; but if she should have more than six children,
then her said husband is to receive a child's part of said
negroes, during his natural life; & at his death such part
to be divided as aforesaid: after her husband has received
his part as above-directed, the remainder of said negroes
to be equally divided among her children, Thomas Ander
son, Ann Elizabeth & such other children as she may
have; this property of said children, however, to remain
in the hands of their father, till one of them shall marry
or come to the age of 21 years, when such child's part shall
be delivered up to him or her, (as the case may be); and so
with the rest successively as they marry or come to the
age of 21 years: ~~  And this disposition of my property is not
made on account of any want of confidence in my
son-in-law Currie, for in him I have every confidence,
but because I wish these negroes to remain among my
descendants. ~~~
        If previous to the death of my daughter Asenath, any of
the above-mentioned negroes should prove ungovernable, I allow
my said daughter & her husband to sell such negro or negroes,
& put out the price upon interest, ~~ said interest, to be used for
the benefit of the family, & the principal to be divided among
her children as before directed with respect to their negroes. ~~

4thly I give & bequeath to my son Thomas Lapslie Armstrong
the following negro slaves; to wit, Enoch, George, Sandy, Susan,
Emiline, & Nancy, together with all their increase at my
death: I further give & devise to him all my interest in a
certain tract of land lying in Montgomery County in the
State of Georgia; also two good beds & furniture ~~~ to him
& his heirs forever. ~~ The remainder of the beds & furniture
to be equally divided among my wife, daughter Frances,
& son Anderson.

[page 4]
5thly I give & bequeath to my Executors hereinafter
named, the following negro slaves; to wit, Yellow Phillis,
Annis, Sarah, Charity, Biddy, Fanny, & Henry Stan=
ford with all their increase at my death, in special
trust & confidence for the sole benefit & use of my
daughter Frances E. Armstrong, to whom on coming
of age or marrying, they are to deliver the possession
of said negroes & their increase; & if after marrying she
should have issue & die before her husband, the same
disposition is to be made of said negroes & their
increase as herein-before directed with regard to
my daughter Asenath & her husband; but should
she die without issue, said property to be
thereupon equally divided among my chil=
dren Anderson, Asenath, and Thomas Lapslie.

        As regards my son James Armstrong,
having already given him, as I consider a suffi=
ciency, I now leave it discretionary with my son
Anderson to make what further provision for him
he may think proper. It is my strong desire
however, that my said son Anderson procure a
sufficient tract of land for the maintenance of
my son James & his family and allow him the free
use of it during his natural life, & at his death
divide said tract of land equally among his
children.

Should any of the negroes hereinbefore bequeathed
to my wife prove ungovernable, I allow my said
wife & Executors, or either of said Exrs hereinafter named
to sell such negro or negroes, & put out the price of
the same upon interest, the said price, at her death,
to be equally divided among my children An-
derson, Asenath, Thomas Lapslie, & Frances E. Armstrong

last will & Testament ~~ In testimony of all
which I have hereunto set my hand & affixed

The petition of Thomas L. Armstrong, James Arm-
strong,
                 vs
Children of Aseneth Currie decd, Martha Morrow
and Thomas Morrow of whom the last two are minors
??? by William Morrow their next friend and regular
guardian

        Respectfully sheweth unto your Honor that
Thomas Armstrong late of the County of Orange died
many years ago leaving a last will & testament which
was duly executed so as to pass his real estate and was
after his death proved in Orange County Court and
is there now of record, that by said will among
other thing he devised a tract of land lying in
Orange County ["to be" x-out] on the watets of Eno adjoining
the lands of Wm. Clark Jas Clarke Nathan=
iel Bain & others, and containing about 400
acres to his widow for life and at her death to
his son Anderson Armstrong in fee. Mrs. Arm-
strong died a few months ago, and the said Ander-
son Armstrong died intestate in Orange County several
years ago, and by his death his title in remainder
to said lands descended to his heirs at law
namely Thomas L. Armstrong, James Armstrong who
has sold his interest in said land to said Thomas L. his bro=

word on the preceding page?]

and heirs at law of his sister Nancy who married Wil=
liam Morrow & is now dead and

The children of Asenath ["Currie" x-out] his sister who

        Your petitioners shew that the said Tract of
land is nearly all cleared & greatly exhausted
by being cultivated and that it could not be divi=
ded among them without serious injury to their
interests.  They therefor pray that the same may be
sold by order of this court and the proceeds of the
sale divided among your petitioners according
to their respective rights therein.

This case coming on to be heard before the
petition and the court being satisfied of the
truth of the matters therein contained, it
is ordered & decreed by the Court that the Clerk
& Master of this Court sell the lands mentioned
in the petition on a credit of twelve months, &
take bond & good security from the purcha=
ser & report to the next term of this court, &
