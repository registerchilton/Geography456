Additional Comments:
No will book copy found.

Draft 2 as labeled above experienced some water damage, but this did not significantly diminish the legibility of the will.

Although there are two drafts of wills in this folder, no will was proved, and Samuel was assigned to administer the estate in February 1832.  There are 57 images of estate papers.  A commission was assigned by the court to divide the land, and another commission to divide the Negroes.  Eleven pages of the estate papers where chosen for inclusion here with a transcription or partial transcription.

Ann Horn was wife of James Horn
Susannah Horn was wife of Joshua Horn, and lived in Giles County, Tennessee
Elizabeth White was wife of Joseph White.  She was deceased at the time of the division of land, and possibly at the time of the writing the of will in 1829, because only her children are listed in the will.
Jacob Couch was living in Pulaski County, Arkansas Territory while the divisions were being made, "for the last three years" in September 1833.

Estate Papers comprise 57 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Couch, Thomas (1832)".
