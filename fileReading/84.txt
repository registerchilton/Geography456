Recorded Nov 1844

The will book copy doesn't shed light on the portions of the will that are indistinct.  It seems the writer of the will book interpreted the original much as I did, so, not much gained in the comparison.

Estate Papers comprise 33 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Clapp, Barney (1844)".

Inventory taken 29 Nov 1844 includes:

"thirteen Negro slaves"

Codicil mentions "negro boy Known and called Samuel or Sam and about seven years [old]" in 1842, so born about 1835
