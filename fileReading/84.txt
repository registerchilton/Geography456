Note 1: The will book copy and the loose will are different at this point.

Estate Papers comprise 68 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Patton, John (1799)".  Testator died "on or about" Jan 1799. Testator's widow is Rebecca.  The provision in the will for William to "maintain" his mother is a bit unusual, and in the estate papers we find out that she was described as a "lunatic" or "insane".

         To the Honorable the Judge of
         said Court - The Bill of Complaint
         of Rebecca Patton by her guardian
         John Patton

Humbly sheweth unto your Honors your
Oratrix Rebecca Patton by her guardian
John Patton that her husband John Pat
-ton died in or about the year 1799 seized
& possessed of a valuable estate real & per
-sonal - that previous to his death he
made & published his last will & test
-tament wherein is contained the fol
-lowing devise "I give & bequeath unto
"my son William four hundred acres of
"land including the plantation whereon
"I now live, Likewise I allow my son William
"to maintain my wife as long as she lives" -
- that the said John Patton died without
having altered or revoked his said will
& that the same since his death towit
at ______ Term ______ of Court of
Pleas & Quarter Sessions of Orange Coun
-ty was duly admitted to probate &
has been recorded - Your Oratrix by her
said Guardian further sheweth that in
the year 1802 or 1803 the devisee William

[page 2]
Patton sold & conveyed the above devised tract
of land to Joseph Glendening & John McDan
-iel one hundred acres thereof to the said Mc=
-Daniel & the ballance to the said Glendening
that at the time of the purchase made by the
said  Glendening & McDaniel of the said
tract of land they know & were apprised
of the terms upon which it was devised to
the said William Patton by his father -- that
is was devised to him burthened with the
support of your Oratrix during her natu
-ral life - as an evidence of this fact she char
-ges that they were witnesses to the will & fur
-ther that at the time they severally purchased the
land it was expressly understood between
them & the said William that they were to take
upon themselves the burthen of so supporting
your Oratrix & that in consequence of such
understanding the land was sold to them
at a price much below its real value ----

Your Oratrix by her said Guardian further
sheweth to your Honor that at the time of
the death of her husband the said John Pat
-ton & for a long time previous thereto she
was a lunatic of unsound memory & that
she continues to be so at this day - That
the said John Patton by whom your Oratrix files
her Bill has been duly appointed her guar
-dian by the County Court of Sumner County
in the State of Tennessee where she has for ma
-ny years resided --- You Oratrix by her said

[page 3]
guardian further sheweth that at the time the
said devised tract of land was sold by William
Patton to the said Glendening & McDaniel she
was living on the same or the plantation
whereon she lived with her husband at the
time of his death - that very soon after the
purchase so made by the said Glendening &
McDaniel (to-wit) in the year 1803 she was
turned off the land by them or one of them
That they or one of them put her in the care of one
John Brigham to carry her to the State of Tennessee
To induce him to do so they gave him the sum
of one hundred dollars, taking a bond from him
payable to them or one of them in like sum & at
the same time for the maintenance of your Oratrix

Your Oratrix by her said guardian further sheweth
that except the said sum of $100 they never have
either jointly or severally contributed one cent to
her support but that she has been since she left
the State & now is entirely dependent on the bounty
of her friends for the food which supports her &
the raiment which covers her --- that she is old, crazy
& infirm & that those friends are but illy able to be
as the sole expense of her maintenance - that
since the appointment of the said John Patton to
be her guardian she has lived wit him & under
his care & protection - without his having any funds
for her support whereby she has become largely in-
-debted to him -- Your Oratrix by her said guardian further sheweth unto
your Honors that she has by the said John Patton
her guardian as aforesaid called upon them the
said John Glendening & John McDaniel to advance
her such a sum of money as would be equivalent to her

[page 4]
support from the time when she was as before stated
put into the possession of Brigham as before stated &
to make arrangement for the annual support dur
-ing her life as they are bound to do not only as owners
of the land but under their contract and agreement
with William Patton as aforesaid all of which she
well hoped they would have done as in Equity & in
good conscience they ought to have done -- But now
so it is may it please your Honors the said Joseph
Glendening & John McDaniel conspiring with di-
-vers other persons whose names at present are un-
-known to your Oratrix, but who when discovered
she prays may be made parties to this her Bill with
apt words to charge them -- how to injure & defraud
Your Oratrix utterly refuse either to pay any thing
["to pay" x-out] for her support during the time that is past
or to make any arrangements for her support the
time to come some times pretending & giving out
that the land was not devised subject the her sup
-port -- & at other times that the said John Brigham
by his bond, to which your Oratrix was no party nor
could he, is bound to support her & they   ???erated

All which actings & doing & pretenses are contrary
to Equity & good conscience & tend to the injury of
your Oratrix -- In tender consideration whereof & for
as much as your Oratrix is without remedy by the
strict rules of Common law & can have redress only
in a court of Equity where matters of fraud & trust
are property cognizable To the end therefore that
the said Joseph Glendening & John McDaniel may
upon their corporal oath full true and perfect answer
make to all & singular the matter & things herein

[page 5]
set forth as fully as if the same were here again repeated
& they more particularly interrogated & particularly whether
the devise of the four hundred acres of land to William
Patton by his father John Patton was not as set forth in
this Bill ? whether they did not sign the said will as witness
is thereto ? whether at the time they purchased said
land from William Patton there was no conversation be
-tween them & the said William relative to their supporting
your Oratrix during her natural life ?  Whether the land
in consequence of being burthened with the maintenance
of your Oratrix was not sold to them at a price far in
-ferior to what it was worth or what it would have sold
supposing such burthen not to have been on it ?  Whether
the or either of them did not promise & agree to with the said William
Patton that they or either of them would support your
Oratrix & exonerate them therefrom or how otherwise ?
What price did they give for the land ? Where they or one
of them did not give John Brigham the sum of $100
or what other sum to take your Oratrix off to Tennessee
where they or either of them did not take from the
said John Brigham a bond payable to them or one of
they to support your Oratrix & indemnify them or either
of them against any claim she might have against
them or either of them or how otherwise ? Whether they or
either of them ever have, except the above sum of one
hundred dollars paid to John Brigham, advanced
on account of your Oratrix one cent ? Whether a demand
has not been made of them or either of them of the tenor
& effect above mentioned ? And that they may be
decreed to pay the said John Patton guardian of you
Oratrix such sum as this Honorable Court may deem
adequate to her support from the year 1803 when she was
put into the care of the said John Brigham down to the
time of rendering the decree & that they may further be
decreed to pay over annually to your Oratrix's guardian

[page 6]
such sum as the Honorable Court may in their judgment deem
sufficient to support her comfortable during the ballance
of her life & that she may have such other & further re
-lief as to this Court may seem proper may it
Please your Honor to grant unto your Oratrix the State
Writ of Subpoena to be directed to the said Joseph Glendening & John
McDaniel commanding them & each of them at a cer
-tain day & under a certain penalty therein to be contain
-ed, personally to be & appear before your Honors in this

& to stand to & abide such order & decree therein as

                  In obedience and pursuant to an order of Reference
made in the above cause at September Term last, I have cause the
parties to be notified to appear before me at my Office in the Town of
Hillsborough on the 2nd day of December 1818 when the Defendants
themselves attended and no one appearing for the Complainant I
proceed to consider of the several matters thereby to me referred and
find that John Patton the last husband of the Complainant Rebecca
Patton departed this life in or about the month of January in the
year 1799 having first made and duly published his last Will and
Testament in writing wherein he devised as follows "I Give & bequeath
"to my Son William Patton Four hundred Acres of Land, likewise I
"allow my son William to maintain my wife as long as she live." And
the said Wm. Patton the devisee on or about the 13th day of July 1801 sold and
conveyed to John McDannel one of the Defendants Eighty seven Acres
of the above trait of Land for the consideration of the Sum of $348
And on or about the 18th day of August 1802 the said William the
devisee sold and conveyed to Joseph Clendenen the other defendant
Three hundred Acres of the said tract of Land for and in consideration
of the Sum of $600 and that the said Clendenen & McDannel after
furnished the said Rebecca Patton with such little necessaries
as they found she stood in need of until about the 9th day of
December in the year 1803 when they are one of them contract
and agreed with one John Briggance of the State of Tennessee
to take her out of the State; and took a Bond from said John
Briggance payable to the said Joseph Clendenen in the
penal Sum of One hundred pound to indemnify him

[page 2]
from any claim which might hereafter arise or accrue by reason
of the support or maintenance of the said Rebecca Patton the
Complainant; and that the said Joseph Clendenen also at the
same time paid to the said John Briggance one hundred dollars
to be applied by him to the support and maintenance of the said
Rebecca the Complainant.

         It appears from the Testimony of Thomas Whitted &
others that the said Rebecca Patton the complainant
(not withstanding appearance of mental derangement at times) was a very
industrious woman capable of doing Ordinary business such as
spinning, Knitting & Sewing and that therefore he believe $40 per annum
would be a fair price for her support and maintenance which
sum I have allowed her from the 9th day of December 1803 to the

  Clendenen & McDaniel         }  -- Orange --

        It is the opinion of the Supreme Court that the motion
to dismiss the Bill should not prevail, because it states that
upon the Sale to defendants, a support for the Complainant
was left in their hands being deducted from the value of
the land for that purpose - It is therefore a trust fund raised
upon a valuable consideration ---------------------------
for the benefit of Complainant , who stand not as a mere
volunteer, but one having a claim on the devisee for
support - not that we believe a consideration necessary
in the transfer of an Equity - But only necessary to raise
on Equity and when once raised to be transfer like
all other rights upon legal evidence of the will of such owner

[page 2]
to make the transfer - It is therefor unnecessary to
divide the question there the devise of the Complainants
maintenance was a charge upon the land
