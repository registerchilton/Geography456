Will of William Kirkland - 16 Oct 1829

I William Kirkland of Orange County in North
Carolina do make and publish this my last Will and Testament
this Sixteenth day of October One thousand eight hundred and Twenty nine

Whereas I am largely indebted to sundry persons especially
upon Notes made by myself or by McNeile & Kirkland and indorsed
by divers of my friends, particularly David Yarbrough, John U. Kirkland,
and Thomas Ruffin, which Notes are negotiable and payable at and
held by the Bank of the United States or by some of the Banks of this
State; and it is my sincere desire effectually to indemnify my said indevers[?]
and to secure the payment of the said debts & finally to pay them and
all others which I may owe or be bound for.  Now to that end, and to
dispose of my worldly substance, I do hereby give, devise, & bequeath my
whole Estate, both real and Personal, wheresoever situate, & all debts due
me, and every interest & valuable thing to me belonging to my son John
U. Kirkland, and my son in Law Thomas Ruffin Esquire (whom I hereby
appoint my Trustees and Executors of this Will) in absolute property
that is to say, the Real Estate, to them and their Heirs, and in case of the
death of one of them to the Survivor and the heirs of the survivors, and
the personalty to them, their Executors and Administrators: -----

   In Trust nevertheless, and for the Uses and purposed herein after mentioned
That is to say, In Trust to collect all monies due to me, and also to make
sale of my Lands and real property and my personal Chattels & Slaves,
or such part of parts thereof as my Trustees and Executors or the
Survivor of them shall in their or his discretion deam[deem] necessary or
proper; and upon such term as to them or him shall seem best, and
at public or private sale, and out of the monies thus collected or
arising from the sale of my said Estates pay of[f] my funeral Expenses,
and the charges of managing and administering my Estate, and
then pay of[f] and satisfy all Debts by me owing in the order following --
Namely, any debt or debts for which the said David Yarbrough
is my security, or any Note or Notes made by me which the said
                                                         Yarbrough

[page 2]
Yarbrough hath endorsed or shall have endorsed for my accommodation in
the first place; And in the next place, such other debts or Notes of mine
for which the said Thomas Ruffin and my son John are, or either is, or
shall be sureties or security by endorsement or otherwise; And in the
third place, any other debt or debts in any manner owing by me
as the principal debtor or one of the principal debtors, And in the
fourth place all and every other debt or debts which I may be legally
bound and liable for as the surety of or endorser for any other person
or persons, if my Estate be sufficient therefor, and if not sufficient to
pay the whole, then each one in equal proportions according to the
amount of the debts: And upon the further Trust as to the whole ---
residue of the said monies and Estates, after making all the said
payments, for the Use and benefit of my Wife Margaret for & during
the term of her natural life; And in relation to this bequest and
declaration of Trust in favour of my Wife, my meaning is, that
my said Trustees or the Survivor may in their or his discretion sell
the whole of my said Estate or only so much thereof as shall be sufficient
to pay the expences, charges, and debts aforesaid; and that as to sich
parts as shall remain unsold after making the payments aforesaid, or
as to the surplus of money, if there be any after those payments to be made,
that my said Trustees or the survivor shall stand seized of the real
Estate and possessed of the personalty to the use and benefit of my said
Wife, & suffer her to receive the profits thereof, and put out the monies
to interest, and pay over to her annually the accruing interest to her
own use during her life And upon the further Trust upon the death
of my Wife, to make sale of all parts of my Estate what kind soever
it may be then remaining unsold, and the proceed[s] thereof as well as
the money then on hand or at interest and the whole residue of my
property to divide into five equal parts or shares, of which I give &
bequeath one to each of my four children Alexander, Mary, Susan,
and Phebe absolutely; and the remaining fifth part or share, I order
and direct to be put out by my Executors to interest to and for the
separate use and benefit of my Daughter Martha during her present
coverture and not subject to the debts, contracts, or disposition of
                                                                  her

[page 3]
her present husband and the interest or profit annually growing thereon during her present
Coverture shall be paid to my said Daughter at her order on the first of
January in each and every year by my Executors if demanded of them
And if my said Daughter should survive her Husband, my said Trustees
and Executors shall then pay to her the whole of the said share forthwith
upon demand in good Bonds; but in case my said Daughter should
die before her Husband and leave a Child or Children, then and in
that case upon her death, I give the said fifth share to such Child of
said Mother, if only one, or to her Children, if more than one, equally
to be divided between them share and share alike --- The situation
of my affairs is such as to make it very uncertain what surplus of my
Estate will remain after the payment of my debts; and feeling, as
I do, the duty of providing with the greatest certainty in my power
for the comfortable livelihood of my Wife in her old Age, I have
considered it most proper and prudent to bestow upon her as I have
herein done the profits of my whole Estate after the payment of my
Debts to discharge which, I think is the first and highest duty ---
Hence[?], I have not made any provision for my younger Children
during their Mothers life, as I doubt not that according to her
ability she will with Maternal feelings afford them proper aid,
and provide for them as Members of her family -- I mention this
in explanation of my Motives and hopes in framing this my Will,
and not as creating thereby any legal obligation on my Wife
to maintain the Children --- which, I trust is altogether unnecessary,
seeing that they may be useful to each other, and their mutual
Affection will form a sufficient bond between them. ---

To the Honorable the Judge of the Court of Equity for the County
of Orange:

    The Bill of Complaint of Edwin L. De Graffenreid
& his wife Martha, Alexander M. Kirkland, Andrew Mickle
Mary Kirkland, Susan Kirkland and ________________
McLester & his wife Phoebe

                      Against

    John U. Kirkland executor & Trustee of William
Kirkland deceased:

    Humbly Complaining sheweth unto your Honor, that
William Kirkland late of the County of Orange departed
this life in the year 1836 having previously made
and published a last will & testament, which remained un-
cancelled & unrevoked at his death, and was properly ex-
cuted for the purpose of passing all his estates, both real
& personal; which will was duly proved at August Term of
of[sic] County Court next ensuing the death toe Test-
tator, when Thomas Ruffin one of the executors & trustees
appointed by said will renounced the said executorship,
and all right to execute the trusts devised & queathed[sic]
to him by said will, but John U. Kirkland, (herein called
defendant) the only other executor & trustee appointed
in & by the said will accepted the same, and was at the
said Court qualified as executor; ["Your" x-out] The Complainants
show unto your Honor, that the said testator by his will left
the whole of his estate, money & effect to the said John
U. Kirkland in trust in the first place, for the payment of his debts;
secondly for the use & benefit of Mrs Margaret Kirkland
the widow & relict of the said William Kirkland, during
her life: And then the said will contains the following
clause, viz, "And upon the further trust, upon the death
of my wife to make sale of all parts of my estate of

[page 2]
what kind soever it ma be then remaining unsold, and
the proceeds thereof as well as the money then on hand or
at interest, and the residue of my property to be divided
into five equal parts or shares, of which I give and bequeath
on to each of my found children, Alexander, Mary, Susan
and Phoebe absolutely, and the remaining firth part or
share, I order and direct to be put out by my executor to
interest to & for the support, use, and benefits of my daugh-
ter Martha during her present coverture & not subject
to the debts contract or distribution of her present Hus-
band & the interest & profits annually growing there-
on during her present coverture shall be paid to my
said daughter or her order on the 10th of January in
each & every year, by my executors if demanded
of them, and if my said daughters should survive her
husband, my said Trustees & Executor shall pay to her
the whole of he said share forthwith upon demand
in good bonds, but in case my said daughter should die
before her husband & leave a child or children, then and
in the case, I give the said fifth share to such child
of said Martha if only one, & to her children if more
than one, equally to be divided between then share
& share alike." The complainants shew that your Orator
Alexander, and your Oratrixes, Martha the wife or you
orator Edwin L. De Graffenreid, Phoebe the wife of your orator
___________ McLester and Susan Kirkland and Mary
Kirkland are the five children of the testator for whom
benefit the the surplus aforesaid was bequeath by the
said will: and the said Alexander by deed executed by him on
the 11th day of July 1839 hath conveyed all his estate right
& interest in his said legacy to your orator Andrew Mickle
["for the" x-out] in trust for the purposes therein mentioned:

    The ["defendants" x-out] complainants further shew unto your Honor, that the estate
& property so left to he said defendant, & of which he possessed
himself as executor & trustee, were of great value, consisting

[page 3]
of lands both in this and other states, & in Florida, a large
number of slaves, stocks of horses, cattle &c, and valuable
stock, & capital in trade, in copartnership with the said
John U Kirkland, in the business of retail merchants,
tannery of leather & other pursuits; besides large
sums of money due to the testator individually, or
to the various copartnerships with the defendant
which property was of value sufficient not only to an-
swer the other trusts of the said testator but also to leave
a large surplus to your orators and oratrixes:

    The Complainants further shew unto your Honor
that Mrs Margaret Kirkland did not long survive her
husband & died in the year 1839 and the debts due
by the said William Kirkland at the time of his death, have
all been paid or should long since have been paid,
by the defendant, as much more than the period allowed
to him for that purpose by the law has expired: And the
complainants had believed[?] that the defendant would promptly have
accounted with them, & paid over to them, their said legacies ac-
cording to the provisions of the will & have frequently applied to
hom for that purpose: but now so it is, may it please your
Honor, the said John U. Kirkland refuses to do it not de-
nying in any respect the right of the Complainants, or that
there is a large surplus to which they are entitled, but he
declares & present to them, that there are certain matters
connected with his settlement with them, upon which he
has great doubt & difficulty, & is on that account, unwilling
to take upon himself the responsibility of making a voluntary
settlement with them: In tender consideration where=
of, And for as much as the Complainants are without
remedy in the premises save in this Honorable Court
where such matters are properly cognizable: To the end
therefor that the said John U. Kirkland may upon
his Corporal oath full true & perfect answer make to
all the ["matter" x-out] allegations & matters in this bill con-

[page 4]
tained, in as full a manner, as if the same were here re-
peated to him by interrogatories; that he may be required to
render a full account of all the estate & money and ef-
fects of the said William Kirkland which came to his hands
as executor & trustee or which ought ["to" blot-out] so to have come to his
hands, together with his administration thereof, and of the
surplus now remaining in his hands, to which the com-
plainants are entitled: And that such other & further
relief may be granted unto them as in the premises they
may be entitled to: May it please your Honor to grant
unto them the States writ of subpoena to be directed
to the said John U. Kirkland Commanding him
to appear at the next term of this Honorable Court
to be held at the Court House in Hillsborough on the
2nd Monday of March next, then and there to an-

that the said Will contains the provisions or
similar ones, recited in the said Bill.  But for
the particular language used by the said testator,
this defendant refers to the will itself of
record in the proper office

    Further answering this defendant saith that
in fulfilling the duties devolved on him by said
will, ["that" x-out] he too acted with the advice and
approbation of his Coexecutor aforesaid, with the
approbation of such of the Legatees, as he found
it convenient to consult, and according to his
Judgment of the best interests of the estate of
the testator - that the estate was deeply indebted
(as was indicated in the primary disposition of this property

[page 2]
by the testator), and Mrs Margaret Kirkland
the widow of testator (for whom use & benefit during
life, the whole estate was given, secondarily)
survived her husband about three years -
that this defendant took into his possession
all of the property monies & effect, of the testator
as far as he had any knowledge of the same,
and has returned a full Inventory thereof,
according to such knowledge, to the office of
the Court of Pleas & Quarter Session of Orange
County: to which he here makes reference
for greater certainty - that in September
1839 he sold ten negroes of the estate at
public auction for the sum of Eight thousand
One Hundred & Ninety six dollars ($8196) - In
November of the same year, he sold the stock,
Household & Kitchen Furniture, six Hundred & Twenty
dollars, sixty seven cents ($2620.67) - In which
latter sum however the purchases of Mrs
Margaret Kirkland widows as aforesaid,
consisting of article deemed necessary to
her comfort and benefit, amounted to
Two thousand & Fifty-eight dollars, twenty-three
cents ($2058.23) which was never collected
for her, but, the property or its increase, as
again by this defendant as Executor - A list
of the articles as purchased by her appears in
the Inventory returned to the County Court as
aforesaid.

    Further Answering this defendant said
that[large x-out] after the death of his mother the aforesaid
Mrs Margaret Kirkland which occurred in
July 1839 [end of x-out] the said widow find two of the
negro women of the estate by name Charity and Suckey refractory & disobedient,
he, at her request sold them for he sum of
Eight Hundred & Eighty four dollars ($884)

[page 3]
                      3
And purchased in their stead a negro
woman named Charity at the sum of Five
Hundred collars.

    Further Answering, this defendant
saith, that after the death of his mother, the
aforesaid Mrs. Margaret Kirkland, which occurred
in July 1839, towit in November of that year
he result all the property purchased by her as
aforesaid, or its increase or residue, and also sold all
the other personal property of the estate of his
Testator, consisting of nine negro slaves for the
aggregate amount of Five thousand seven
Hundred & Fifty seven dollars ($5757.)
He has also made sale, at different times,
of land of his Testator, to the amount of
Thirteen Thousand six Hundred & six dollars
($13606.). A particular account of these several
sales, of the times, and terms, on which they
were made, and to whom is appended hereunto
and is prayed to be taken as a part of this
answer  It shews a receipt of assets by this
defendant to the amount of Twenty eight
Thousand, one Hundred & Twenty one dollars
& Forty four cents ($28121.44.). In addition to
this sum, this defendant has received Eight
or Nine Hundred dollars from the sale of some
of the lands of his Testator in Tennessee
whether this sum belongs wholly to testator or is to be divided with the partners[?] he is ignorant.  As
there land lie at so great a distance from home, this defendant has been obliged to
administer them through an agent and has relied much on them being attended to by the Colonel Thomas Ruffin
who had a personal interest in & acquaintance with the title, which the defendant [???] and he is
unable to state, what portions, or how much
of them, have been sold,  He understands that
there is a content pending at Law, in that state
as to the title of some portions of these lands
but to what particular tract it appertains, he
is ignorant.  He has confidence in the fidelity of the
agent who has been administering the interest of
                                            the

[page 4]
                      4
the estate in that country and believes that they
will be properly attended to, but as yet he
is not informed their particular condition
further than is herein stated. He has set forth
in his Inventory every tract of which he has
any knowledge, and is willing to dispose of any
part that may be unsold, according to the direction
of this Court.

    One Lot belonging to testator at his
death in the Town of Columbus Georgia, &
occupied by the Plaintiff E. L. De Graffenreidt
& family, this defendant is advised did not
pass by the devise in the will aforesaid as
it was purchased after the date of said
Will, and has been, or by agreement, will be
conveyed by the Heirs at Law of Testator for the
use & benefit of said family 0 they being
charged in the receipt of their Legacy under
the Will with the sum of $500, the amount
paid by the Testator for the purchase of said
Lot - with interest thereon since his death.

    The land in Florida, this defendant under-
-stands, depend on a disputed title, and he has
made no attempt to dispose of them, believing
that they would yield nothing untill that
controversy shall be settled.

    This defendant has also received rents
from some of the real estate aforesaid & some debts
due to Testator, but deems it unnecessary to set
them forth here, in detail, as he will be prepared
to render a full account of them, when this
court shall so order.

    Further answering this defendant saith that
he believes the foregoing to be a correct account
of the individual estate of his testator which
came to his hands.

[page 5 - very short page?]

This defendant submits to a full and fair account
of all the affairs of this firm, but not having stated
the account particularly, he is unable now to say
what, if any thing is due.

[page 6]
                   6
    In addition to these, he admits that
his testator was equally concerned with him,
this defendant, in the following partnership concerns
Towit 1. In a shoe shop, managed by William
H. Brown, This was a small concern set up
by the partners for the purpose of disposing of the surplus Leather
of which they were Tanners, after being
manufactured into shoes and continued but two years - the accounts thereof
have not been [x-out] all settled, but it is
believed that there will be but little if any
thing due to the estate of testator from this
source.

2.  In a Tan Yard under the style of William
Kirkland & Co, in the Town of Hillsboro: The
business of this concern was carried on
after the death of Testator untill the death
of his widow.  The entire interest ["of Testator" x-out] in the
concern was then exposed to sale at public
auction under the direction of said will by the knowledge & consent of such
of the Legatees as were in the vicinity & capable
of being consulted, and was purchased
with their approbation by the defendant at the sum of ["Three" x-out]
["Thousand" x-out] seven thousand Five Hundred
dollars [large x-out] which is its full value.  This defendant
being an equal partner in the concern, became
thus chargeable to this Testator's estate in the
sum of Three Thousand Seven Hundred
& Fifty dollars ($3750) He believe afore/upon? as
fair statement of the account of this firm, that
but little if any thing beyond that sum
will be due to his Testator's estate
The Testator himself having ???? the management thereof during his life

[x-out ends]

3. In a store, of Merchandise in Hillsboro under the style of Wm Kirkland & Son: this
defendant by the persuasion of members of the family
was prevailed on to become the purchaser of the goods
of this firm on hand at Testators death.  Accord-
ingly he & Alexander M. Kirkland, who was a merchant,
and the only male among the Five Legatees entitled to the
                                                Legacy

[page 7]
Legacy in question, took on Inventory of said
goods, and selected William Cain & Dr James
Webb as arbitrators to fix the price. They
decided that this defendant must pay for
these 20 per cent less than the original cost, which
made the whole stock worth six thousand
dollars and a small over, as will appear by reference to the charge on the books
and this defendant chargeable in
the settlement with ["Testators estate in the sum of" x-out]
["Three thousand dollar at six and twelve months with interest after six months"]
that concern with this sum.
The stock of goods
was in great part old, the business having
been carried on many years, and this
defendant is well assured that the purchase
was highly injurious to him, and far more
beneficial to the estate than if the good had
been sold according to the usual course.

   This defendant has not balanced the books
of this concern but believes that Testators
estate will be indebted to it.  Its business had
been carried on, from the year 1824 till
Testators death and was profitable.  And
from it, Testator was in the habit of drawing resources
for several years, before his death, to reduce
the heavy debts which stood against him
individually - At the same time with the sale of
the Tanyard, this defendant also sold at public
auction the store House in Hillboro' belonging to
William Kirkland & Son, in which their business
was carried on, Lot No 25 and became the purchaser
himself at the sim of Twelve Hundred dollars
which was its full value Thereby becoming chargeable with that sum ["of $1200" x-out]
in settlement with that concern.
                                Further answering this
defendant saith, that he had made disbursements on
account of said estate to the amount of sixteen
thousand, seven Hundred & Twenty four dollars, & ninety three
cents ($16724.93.).  The particulars of which are contained
in a statement marked B appended hereunto, & which
is prayed to be taken as a part hereof.

[page 8]
[large x-out]
that he has also an account against the estate of
his testator for articles furnished & payment made
??? to the qualification of this defendant as Executor,
amount of the sum of seven Hundred & Eight
dollars 19/100 ($708.19) [end of x-out]  That he has also on account
again said estate, for article furnished.
and payments on account of Mrs Margaret
Kirkland after testators death and before her
death, amounting to the sum of Two Thousand six
hundred and seven dollars, thirty one cents ($2607.31) -
she continued to keep house at the mansion of
testator during her life, and this account arose
in furnishing her with the supplies deemed necess-
-ary and proper for her subsistence and comfort,
and that of her family. This defendant is advised
that as the whole estate is charged with her
support, after payment of debts, by the will of
testator, that this amount is unquestionably to be
paid out of the same, And he alleges, that it is
moreover equitable, that it should be so paid,
as regards the plaintiffs, for each one of them,
or some members of the family of each, of those, among
them, having families, resided with the said
widow during the period, when said supplies
were furnished, and participated of the same.
He further states, that by the term of the Trust
deed, mentioned in Plaintiffs Bill, as having been
executed by the aforesaid Alexander M. Kirkland,
provision is made for the payment of a debt due,
from him, to the firm of William Kirkland & Sons,
amount to six Hundred & Fifty dollars ($650.)
and interest, and that he is thus entitled to
change this amount against his legacy aforesaid

Further answering this defendant saith, that
he had at sundry times advanced to the different
legatees, in part payment of their said legacies
the following sums of money Towit

[page 9]

+ This defendant by advice of his counsel also
appends a list of certain large debts due,
some of them wholly and others in part from
the estate of his testator which are outstanding
and unpaid.  It is hereunto attached marked
C and prayed to be taken as part hereof.
He believe there are other debts of less amount
but these are particularized from their magnitude.

                                               650.

and there will be the sum of ________________________
_______________ which this defendant has paid out
or will be entitled to retain, from the effects of
said estate exclusive of his claim to commission
which he prays this court to allow, according to
the course of the Court in similar cases.

    This defendant expects to be able to shew still further
credits to which he is entitled on taking the accounts,
under the order of this Court, to which he humbly
submits whenever the Court shall so order &
direct.

    This defendant admits the assignment mentioned
in the Bill as having been made by Alexr. M. Kirkland
and pray that the deed of assignment may be produced.
He also admits that the said A. M. Kirkland has
departed this life.
                       And denying all fraud or improper
conduct on his part, this defendant pray to be hence
dismissed with his costs in this behalf.
