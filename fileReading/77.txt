of the Superior Court of Equity for said County; the
Bill of Complaint if John Ray and Mary his Wife,
John Rhew and Marg his Wife, Thomas Copley and
Sarah his Wife; Gilbert Ainsley and Airy his Wife, Ben-
jamin Brittain and Comfort his Wife; George Carring-
ton and Sophia his Wife, which said Mary, Marga-
ret, Sarah Airy, Comfort and Sophia together with
Nancy Dunnegan herein after named are the ["dau" x-out]
daughters of William Dunnagan late of the County
aforesaid, deceased --- Your orators and oratrixes
shew that the said William Dunnagan depart-
ed this life in about the year ______ having made
and published his last Will & Testament in writing
of record in Orange County Court, ready to be pro-
duced upon Required, a ????, and where by among
other things, / in substance/ he devised to his wife Sa-
rah during her life or widowhood the following
Viz: two Negroes Cesar and Dover; together with
all his stock of Horses, Cattle, Sheep Hogs, Household
and Kitchen furniture, plantation utensils, &c
to be used by her during the life or widowhood
of the said Sarah, and afterword to be equally
divided amongst your Oratrixes and the said
Nancy Dunnegan his daughters -- Your Ora-
tors and Oratrixes further shew that after the
death of their father the said William, their Mo-
there the said Sarah took [x-out] into her possession the
aforesaid Negroes, stock of all kinds, Household
and Kitchen furniture, plantation utensils, &c--
and that the said property was valued and appraised
by competent persons duly appoint for that purpose
at the time the said Sarah took the same into her
possession at the Sum of One thousand, three Hundred
pounds --- Your Orators and Oratrixes further shew

[page 2]
that it was not necessary to sell or dispose of any part
of the said property, (the use whereof was claimed to the
said Sarah during her life or Widowhood) for the pur-
pose of discharging debts; the Estate being entirely clear
of debt or encumbrances of any Kind -- Your Orators
and Oratrixes now particularly charge, that the sd.
Sarah Dunnegan in combination with, and by the
assistances of the said Nancy Dunnagan, who lives
with her, has committed and doing, and is continually
committing and doing great and ruinous hurt in
 and of the property the use whereof She is entitled to
in manner aforesaid, to the utter destruction thereof
and highly prejudiced to the rights of  Your Orators &
Oratrixes under the Will of aforesaid; more particularly
they charge that the said Sarah in combination with
and by the assistance of her confederate that said
Nancy Dunnagan, hath sold and disposed of a va-
luable waggon belonging to said Estate - hath sold
and ????? away the most valuable of the Horses
belonging thereto, and converted the proceeds of the
same to their own use --- That for the purpose of
exhausting the said property , and defeating your
Orators and Oratrixes just rights thereto as far as
they possibly can - the said Sarah hath granted
several voluntary Notes, without any lawful or
valid consideration, to the said Nancy Dunnagan
for divers large sums of Money - on which said
pretended and fraudulent Notes, the said Sarah
hath confessed Judgments; on which Executions have
issued and been levied on the property aforesaid
or a part thereof and the said Nancy hath received
the Money arising from the sale of the said property
by the fraudulent connivance and with the assistance
of the said Sarah -
                       Your Orators and Oratrixes
further shew and charge that by the fraudulent and
inequitous means aforesaid, as well as by the use
of others expediences equally so, the said Sarah

[page 3]
and Nancy Dunnagan have wasted more than half of
property, whereof the said Sarah is entitled to have the use dur-
ing her life or Widowhood - that they are continually wasting
and destroying the same, and threatened to consume it in
any way they can, for the express and avowed purpose of
diverting any part thereof after the death of the said
Sarah, coming to your Orators and Oratrixes; -- And
Your Orators  and Oratrixes verily believe that they the
said Sarah and Nancy will certainly consume waste
and destroy the whole of the said property, unless they
are restrained by the interposition of this Honorable
Court, which can alone arrest the Rapid progress they
are daily making in the destruction thereof --- And
for as much as your Orators and Oratrixes can have
as remedy in the premises, save only in this Court
whose powers they are advised and believe can preside
and apply a fit remedy for wrongs done, and yet
doing by the aforesaid Sarah and Nancy Dunnagan

To the end therefore that the said Sarah & Nancy
(whom your Orators and Oratrixes pray may be taken
as defendants to this Bill) may be called to account
for the waste and destruction committed to the said
property - they they may be enjoined from committing
further waste thereon or thereof -- and that they may
on their corporal oaths, full, true, and perfect answer
make to all and singular the matters herein set forth
and charged, in as full and ample demurrer, as if the
same were again repeated; and they thereunto specially
interrogated --- more particularly that the said
Sarah may set forth and discover, what and how
much property she was entitled to the sue of during her
life or widowhood by the last will and Testament of
the said William - what the nature and value though
at the time of same came to her hands and possessed
of ? -- For many Houses - Cattle, Hogs, Sheep &c -- Waggons
&c their value and how disposed of ? --
[page 4]
How many Notes, Bonds or Obligations hath she granted to
the said Nancy and for what Sums? -- Whether the same
and not voluntary, and without any lawful or valid
consideration? -- Whether Judgments have not been obtain-
ed or the same in favour of the said Nancy Dunnegan
by the confession of the said Sarah, or how obtained? --
whether Executions have not issued -- thereon, and been de-
vised on some part of the property the use whereof she is
entitled to as aforesaid; and whether the same or some
part thereof hath not been actually sold to satisfy said
fraudulent and pretended [x-out] Notes Judgments
and Executions? And whether the said Nancy hath
not received the Money arising [x-out] from such Sales
and now much? ---
                           That the said Nancy Dunna-
gan may set forth and discover, what part of the said
Estate hath come to her hands, use or possession; the na-
ture and value there of? -- How many of the Houses [Horses] be
longing to the said Estate, hath she received from her
mother the said Sarah by pretended gifts or otherwise?
and how many has she sold ????? or otherwise
appropriated the her own use?  How many Notes, Bonds
or Obligations, hath the said Sarah executed to or for her
use?  And what the amount there of? Whether the same
can not voluntary and without Consideration?
Whether she hath not obtained Judgments whom by the
confession of the said Sarah or otherwise? Whether any
or what part of the Estate belonging to the said William
Dunnegan, hath been sold the pay the same? -- How
much Money hath she received by virtue of such
Notes, Judgments and Executions?

                     Your Orators and Oratrixes
pray that the said Sarah and Nancy may be required
& compelled to account for the value of the property which
hath been wasted by them --- that they may be restrained
and enjoined from committing or doing any other or
further waste thereon -- that the ["y ?" x-out] said Sarah may
be required to give ample Security for the safe-keep

[Estate Papers - Answer by Sarah Dunnagan 20 Aug 1811]

North Carolina }
Orange County } In Equity

                      The separate Answer of Sarah Dunagan to the Bill
           of Complaint of John Ray and Mary his wife, John Rhew
           and Margaret his Wife, Thomas Copley and Sarah his Wife,
           Gilbert Ansley and Airey his Wife, Benjamin Brittain and
           Comfort his Wife, and George Carrington and Sophia his
           Wife, against this Defendant and Nancy Dunagan

                      This Defendant saving and reserving to herself
now and at all times hereafter, all manner of benefit and advantage
of exceptions to the uncertainties and insufficiencies in and of this
said Bill of Complaint for answer thereto or unto so much thereof as
she is advised is material for her to answer, She answering saith,
it is true William Dunnagan her late Husband, in his lifetime,
duly made and published, in writing, his last will and testament
and departed his this life on or about the 15th day of November 1798,
which said Will was soon afterwards duly proved in Orange
County Court and committed to Record.  But this Defendant denies
that the tenor and effect of the said Will is as stated by the Complain
=ants in their Bill.  And saith that the property willed to her
for life, was, and is subject in her hands to the payment of the
Debts of the Testator; for he expressly provided by the Will that
no division of the said property should be made amongst
the Children until all his debts were paid.  He also directed
by his said Will that the Daughter[s] then unmarried should
receive a portion equal in value to what those had received
who were married, and that the remainder only should be
divided; and he also charged the said property with a
Legacy to Peggy, one of the Complainants, of a horse at £15,
saddle £5 and Bridle 15/.: all of which will more fully and
accurately appear by the Will, to a Copy thereof, this Defendant
for greater certainty begs leave to refer ---

[page 2]
This Defendant further saith that at the death of the Testator Mary
Ray and Margaret Rhew two of the Complainants and Nancy
Dunnagan the other Defendant, were unmarried; and that she
was advised, and believes, that they, by virtue of the Will, had a right
to reside in her house, and to be maintained by the estate until
they should marry and receive the portions bequeath to them
as aforesaid and they did accordingly reside with her generally
and were so maintained.

    This Defendant further saith that the Testator did upwards
of twelve years ago, that she is now nearly seventy one years of
age and during the last eight or nine years has been very inform,
that she has no list or memorandum of the property which was
delivered over to her by virtue of the bequest to her for life; and
that she is, for these reasons, unable to render an account of
the same.  She admits, that at the time the property was delivered
over to her by the Executors, a particular list was taken of it, which
She supposes was correct, and was kept by the Executors or some of the parties
Interested; and she refers to that paper as containing a list of her said
property.

    This Defendant further saith that had the horses delivered over
to her as aforesaid remained on the plantation till this time,
they would have been of little or no value.  But unportionality[?]
several of of them, with others procured by Defendant, died within
a few years after the Testator, without any  mismanagement
or neglect of the defendant.  She swapped an old horse called
John Dougles for a Roan Mare, the mare had two Colts
and she died, being killed as was then supposed and
the Defendant believes by the Groups; leaving one Colt
only about three weeks old; which was raised with difficulty,
by the constant care and attention of Nancy the other
Defendant.  She swapped another of the Horses, she was coming[?]
for a sorrel mare, she died soon afterward with the

[page 3]
disease called the Yellow Water. And about the same time
a Horse which she had purchased at the price of eighty five dollars,
and a colt delivered over to her by the Executors, died of the
same disease - This Defendant further saith that about nine
years ago she lost, without her mismanagement or neglect, by
the disease called the distemper, eighteen head of the best cattle
she had, leaving her only two yearlings; that her sheep, as is
usual in that part of the Country raised in the woods, and were
attacked by the dogs and seventeen of them either killed, or
so driven off that she could not obtain them again; leaving her
only four; And that the first year after the death of the Testator,
She lost about half the Stock of hogs with the distemper which
usually attacks hogs in the fall season of the year --- This Defendant
further saith that she, by reason of her infirmities, has been under the
necessity of calling a Physician several times to her assistance, and
consequently to pay considerable sums of money ---

    This Defendant further saith that George Carrington one of the
Complainants reserved a Judgment for a debt due, as he alledged, to
him from the Testator in his lifetime, for three pounds and upwards
to which the property in the hands of this Defendant was liable; and
also another Judgment against this Defendant for the sum of twenty
pounds or thereabouts, due for necessaries and some things purchased
for the unmarried Daughter;  Executions issued on the said
Judgments, and were levied on a Table, a Cubb[o]ard, a Bed
and Bedstead, property of the estate, which articles were sold
by the Constable and purchased by Nancy Dunnagan the other
Defendant. This Defendant having no money to discharge the same.

    This Defendant admits that she sold a Horse to James
Horton, but saith that she had purchased that horse herself,
and that the money for that Horse has never been paid --
She also admits that she sold one of the nags delivered over to her,
a blind mare, about ten or eleven years ago, for £22.10, and also

[page 5]
one Cow for £6, and saith that she has sold no more of the property to her
recollection except the waggon mentioned in the Bill --

    This Defendant denies that she has entered into combination with
Nancy the other Defendant, or any other person, for the purpose, or
with the intent of commit waste of the property so committed
to her care; and that she ever threatened to do so within her
recollection; but saith that she has at all times, and still doth,
with the assistance of the said Nancey, manage the said property
with all the industry, care, and skill she has been[?], and is capable
of, and as she believes and hopes to prove with actual[?] care
and skill --

    This Defendant admits that she sold a waggon, part of the
said property for £22.10, about three years after the death of the
Testator; and saith that the same waggon had been running
about twenty years before the death of the Testator, was nearly
quite run down, although she had had it several times
repaired, and s[h]ould[?]  have been of little or no value then in
Remainder.

    This Defendant further saith that John Ray & Mary his
Wife, John Rhew and Peggy his Wife, Gilbert Ansley and
Airey his Wife and Nancy Dunnegan, have respectively
received the Article state in the schedule hereunto annexed,
as delivered to them, of the property aforesaid, or of the profits
thereof, and are chargeable with the same; and prays that
the said Schedule may be taken as part of this her answer

    This Defendant further saith that before the Marriage of
Peggy with John Rhew, Nancy the other Defendant had, by
spinning, weaving and otherwise earned and received about thirty[?]
eight dollars, and advanced it to the use of this Defendant; and

[page 6]
during her infirmness for the space of eight or nine years, and
particularly the last three years, within which this Defendant was
able to do very little for herself, and had no female slave,
Nancy the other Defendant waited and attended on her, and
did and performed, generally, the cooking and other household
business; in consideration of which money and service this Defen
dant did on the 18th day of June 1810 execute to the said Nancy
two notes for twenty five pounds each payable two days
after the date thereof, but no judgments have been obtained
on the same to the knowledge of this Defendant, and she
further saith that those are all the Notes she ever executed
to the said Nancy Dunnagan

    This Defendant is advised and insists that if stock and
other perishable property devised for life, dies or otherwise perishes
during the life of tenant for life, the Tenant for life is not chargeable
but the loss is to those in remainder; and that if the profits
of property bequeathed to a widow for her maintenance and
the maintenance of younger children is not sufficient to
maintain therein the property itself may be applied to that
purpose

    This Defendant denies all and all manner of
unlawful ambition wherewith she stands charged,
without that, that &c - and prays to be hence dismissed
with her costs --
