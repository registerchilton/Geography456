Will Book scribe does not make a distinction between "a" and "o", so these are interpreted based on context.

Estate Papers comprise 13 pages found in a folder labeled "Squires, Thomas (1866)".  Understandably, due to the time frame there are references to Confederate funds and state treasury notes, etc.
