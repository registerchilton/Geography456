Estate Papers comprise 30 pages and are found in folder labeled "Redding, Thomas (1828)", and these papers are for at least two testators, one with a widow named Elizabeth, and administered by Moses McCown.  The widow listed in the above will was Mary, and the executor is John Reding with the inventory taken after Mary's death.  There is an additional administrator is appointed in these papers, but it is not clear which Thomas Reding he was assigned.

The inventory that definitely belongs to the above will does not contain family history.
