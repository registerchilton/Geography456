Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume C, pages 91-92
Recorded Nov 1796

Writer of the will seems to randomly use curlicues at the end of words, so there might be some words with extra "e" endings in this transcription.  Also there are enough variations of spellings of the same word throughout, that this appears to be deliberate.

No estate papers found.
