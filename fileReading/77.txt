Estate Papers comprise 42 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Piper, Samuel (1869)".  No family history found.  If the negroes mentioned in the will were sold, there is no record here. It appears that the probate began after emancipation.  The final settlement of this estate appears to have occurred in the 1870's.
