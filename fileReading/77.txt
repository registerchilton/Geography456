            Dear Brother,
it is with a sad heart I take my pen to inform
you that I Recd your letter informing me of the death of
my last Earthly parent the mournful inteligence
fell heavily on one Who has Ever cherished the
most tender Regard for a kind and affectionate
Father but we all must Die and the best of friends have
to part and if we can be prepared it will be a happy
Exchange for the affliction and cares of this
world it is a great consolation to believe that
our Father is Done with the suferings and is now
happy in the presence of his Redeemer and
all those happy Spirits that have gone before
we should all make it our chief consern to be
prepared to meet our Friends in that blesed
World  I feel a deep concern for Jane and Winefred
they are in a helpless condition Willis cant make
a suport for them all and I think it would be
best for them to break up you Did not say
anything about Debts of corse I k[n]ow nothing
about the condition of the Estate or what the
children Intend Doing if they Determine on
staying thare and thare is any Debt you must
sell such property as the can do best without and
pay the Debts if they think it best to brake up

[page 5]
I want then to come to georgia they can
get a home with me and Richard as long as
we have a home I want some of you to write
soon and let me know what they intend Doing
and let me know all the perticulars of their
Situation and then I will be better prepared
to give them advice the ["that" x-out] Will that was
not signed of course cannot be Executed it
is out of my power to go thare at present
and it is also unnessessary for me to act
it will be your Duty to carry out the Will
as for whats left me if they Determine to
Remain thare they can keep it until I call
for it and Richards the same if they Dont
want Richards mare sell her and keep the
money an[d] use it if they need it if they wish

management of the Estate but Just carry

gloomy prospect out her[e] for living our
corn crops are Ruined thare is a great many
that wont make corn enough to bread
