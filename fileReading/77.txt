[Estate Papers - Petition of James Griffin, et al May 1843]

North Carolina " Court of Pleas & Qr Sessions
Orange County } May Term 1843

    To the Worshipful, the Justices of said Court

        The Petition of James Griffin William Griffin
        & Elizabeth McDaniel
                        vs

Jesse O'Daniel Henry O'Daniel, Hugh Waddell & Peggy
Griffin Alfred Pickard & wife Peggy James Thomas Pickard
Lilla Wisk & Rebecca Wicks & Thomas Griffin

Humbly complaining your Petitioners represent unto your Worships
that at August Term 1842 of this Worshipful Court a paper writing
was propounded for probate as the last Will & Testament of the
late Thomas Griffin by one Jesse O'Daniel a pretended executor
therein mentioned & was admitted to probate in common form
by the oath of two of the three subscribing witnesses the third not
having been sworn or examined.  That at said Term the
aforesaid Jesse O'Daniel qualified as executor to said pretended
last Will & Testament & Hugh Waddell also named therein
as executor came into open Court & refused to qualify as executor, but
renounced his right to the same, all of which will fully appear by
reference to the records of this court.

    Your Petitioners further shew that in said paper, after disposing
of comparatively an insignificant part of his estate, the great bulk
of the estate of said Thomas Griffin consisting of a considerable quantity
of valuable land & negroes, is given to the said Jesse O'Daniel &
Henry O'Daniel two individuals for whom as your Petitioners verily
believe, the said Thomas Griffin, so far from having any affection
or even respect entertained feelings of disgust & hatred & regarded
them as the enemies of his peace & the evil spirits that constantly
hovered around him to mar the peace of his last days --

Again your petitioners are informed & believe & so state that the
said Jesse & Henry O'Daniel had been the enemies of the said
Thomas, & were for some time engaged in an important suit
at law against the said Thomas, seeking to receive some of
the very slaves, which they now pretend were bequeathed to
them by their former adversary & further they believe that this

[page 2]
open hostility continued until the said Jesse & Henry found them-
=selves unable to compass their ends through the medium of the Courts
of Justices, & then & not till then with systematic efforts, regardless
& unscrupulous of the means, & with a will circumscribed & controlled
only by their ability to do mischief, resolved to accomplish by chicanery
& dishonesty what they were unable to do by other means - Then
by a series of basely conceived but well directed efforts, the said
Jesse & Henry sought (as your petitioners understand & believe)
to obtain a complete control over the mind & acts of the said
Thomas Griffin & were but too successful in their corrupt designs
for your petitioners verily believe & so charge, that after having put
in motion for some time every engine which the most sordid
mind could employ (& that too while the old man Thos Griffin
was in very feeble health & while his mind from a protracted
disease had lost its power, & when timidity had taken the
place of firmness at last got such a mastery over the poor old
man as rendered him in truth a mere slave & tool in their
hands, that their power & influence was so complete, that the
old man ceased in truth to be a free agent in the management
of his affairs or the disposition of this property & was as your Petitioners
are informed & believe & so charge, afraid to take any step in
the disposition of his property without the knowledge of the said Jesse
& Henry - Your Petitioners further state that having acquired such
command the old man as to be able completely to control his actions,
they constrained him to sign the aforesaid pretended will
contrary to his will & desire, whereby he was made to bestow the
bulk of his estate upon these two base conspirators & unworthy
recipients of his bounty Jesse & Henry O'Daniel ---

    Your Petitioners are informed & believe & so charge, that the
said Thomas Griffin often & repeatedly expressed his dissatisfaction
at having signed such a paper, that it was not his desire &
never had been, that these two creatures (who daily & hourly
infested his house with their unwelcome presence & robbed him
of the few small moments of ease & relief which he might have
snatched from disease) should ever receive any portion of his
property, but that it was his wish (if uncontrolled by the fear of
the said Jesse & Henry) to bestow his property upon his heirs at law
or next of kin, who are your Petitioners - & they believe & so charge

[page 3]
that but for the fear of bodily harm from the said Jesse & Henry
the said Thomas Griffin would have made a will before his death
& would have given the bulk of his property to your petitioners, but
that the old man had conceived such a dread of the said
O'Daniels, that he was afraid in any way to oppose their wishes
believing as he did that for any resistance to their desire, or
command his life would pay the penalty. ---

    Your Petitioners further shew that the said Thomas Griffin died
some time in 1842, possessed of large estate real & personal that
they are his heirs at law & distributors (as they insist that he died
intestate) & that the alledged last Will & Testament of Thomas
Griffin was admitted to probate without any notice to your Petiti-
=ioners, or any of them having been "cited to see the proceedings
& were not parties or privy to the same - that the same was done
without their consent or approbation & that said probate by
the said pretended executor Jessee O'Daniel was a fraud
upon the Court & they therefore pray your Worships that the
same may be recalled & set aside & that your Petitioners may
be at liberty to contest the validity of said alledged will.

    And your Petitioners pray your worships that the said
Jessee & Henry O'Daniel & the other dfts may be served
with process to appear at May Term 1843 of this Court & on
their corporal oaths answer the matters & the matters & things
set forth in the Petition as distinctly & particularly as if they
were separately interrogated as to the same

and Elias Milliken
                    Against
              Henry O'Daniel Admr &c

    Humbly sheweth the unto your worships Thomas Grif-
fin late of the County of Orange departed this life
in the County aforesaid in the year 1840[sic] having
first ["left" x-out] made a last will & testament which was executed
will[with] all due form & solemn & was sufficient
to pass both his real and personal estate, which will
was unrevoken[sic] at the time of his death & hath been duly
proved in Orange County Court & is now of record in this
proper office: Your petitioners further shew that in
& by said will the said Griffin bequeath to Rebecca
Wicks a legacy of One thousand dollars to be paid
to her [x-out] on her arrival at twenty one years
of age or marriage, and the executors named
in the said will having renounced their right as such
administration with the will annexed hath been
granted to the defendant Henry O'Daniel who hath
taken upon himself the burthen of executing the
same.

    Your petitioners further shew that the said Rebec=
ca Wicks on the 22nd day of October last intermarried
with your petitioner Henderson Griffin, & that before the
marriage was solemnized, & on the same day they
both joined in a conveyance & assignment of the said
legacy to your other petitioner Elias Milliken in trust
for the sole & separate use of the said Rebecca &
free from the control of her husband, or of any lia-

[page 2]
bility for his debts. And they further shew that they
have by themselves & by their said trustee frequently de-
manded the said legacy of the said Henry O'Daniel,
to be paid to their said Trustee, but he will not [pay] over
the same & will not give them any positive promise
or appearance that it shall be paid at any given
day or within any reasonable time.

    Your petitioners therefore pray your
worships that the said legacy may be paid over
to their said Trustee & that such others & for their
relief may be granted them as in the premises
they are entitled to: And to this end that a copy
