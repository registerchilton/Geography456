This will was is not complete, appears to be some type of practice document, and was not proved.

Estate papers comprise 13 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Leathers, Moses (1861)".  Benton Ray was appointed Administrator.  Inventory was returned to May 1861 term of the court. Some of these papers pertain to the estate of Moses Leathers, Jr., whose estate was administered in 1867.
