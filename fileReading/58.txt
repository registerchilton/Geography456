Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume B, pages 259-261
Recorded Feb 1794

Wife referred to as Emelia and Emilia in Will, Milly in Estate papers.

The unusual notations about Benjamin being "well used" in the will is connected to an affidavit in the Estate Papers: "a jury to inquire into the Lunacy or Ediocy of Benj. Cate orphan of Richd. Cate Decd.", referring to the February Court Term of 1807 when John Cate was appointed Benjamin's guardian, resigning in 1810 with "Amelia Cate" taking his place as Benjamin's guardian.  Some of the Estate papers document the Amelia's petition regarding the income from the hiring out of Ned and Lucy between 1807 and 1810 and the income not being applied to Benjamin's benefit by John Cate and also prior to that by the executors...

"Hasten" surname is perhaps referred to in the Estate papers with reference to  "Henry Hastings"

Inventory of slaves is obviously taken after the distribution of the bequests in the will

Estate Papers comprise 31 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Cate, Richard (1794)"
