Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume F, pages 486-487
Recorded May 1851

This will is undated.

The spelling of the Rigsby surname varies throughout.  The loose will is mostly "Rigsbey" and some "Rigsby".   The will book version is consistently "Rigsbey" with one "Rigsbee"

Estate Papers are found in two folders.  The first, labeled "Rigsbee, Elizabeth (1850)" comprises three pages and contains the Administrator Bond.  Jesse and Mark Rigsby were bonded for $6,000 on 28 August 1850.  This is unusual when the executors are named in the will as Jesse and Mark Rigsby are.

The second folder, labeled "Rigsbey, Elizabeth (1850)" comprises 51 pages.  The inventory lists "Six Likely Negroes".  The will was presented for probabte to the court of Pleas and Quarter Sessions on the 27th (the fourth Monday) of May 1850.  There was a caveat entered by Edy Anderson, et al on the 1st of June 1850.  In Superior Court, a review by jury was made and a writ of procedendo issued to the effect that it was indeed the will of Elizabeth Rigsby on 10 Apr 1851.

Edy Anderson, AKA Eady AKA Edith

The negroes mentioned in the will were sold on the 17th of May 1850.  Unfortunately, their names were not listed.
