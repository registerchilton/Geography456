State of North Carolina, being of sound mind
and memory, do make and declare this my last

First ~ That my Executor (hereinafter named)shall
provide for my body a decent burial, suitable
to the wishes of my family and pay all funeral
expenses, together with my just debts, out of the
monies that may first come into his hands as a
part of my estate ~~

And Secondly ~ In order that this may be done, I
give, bequeath and devise to my friend Doctor
Edmund Strudwick, who is also my largest creditor,
all of my estate, both real and personal, of every
description, and wheresoever situated to him, his
heirs, executors and administrators forever, with
full power to sell, or otherwise dispose of the same
in whole or in part, in such manner, and upon
such terms, and at such time as in his discretion
may seem best for the interest of my creditors,
and the estate ~~

my friend Dr Edmund Strudwick my lawful
Executor to execute this my last Will and Testament,

indebted, may if possible receive all I own my property is small
my debts many, Dr. Strudwick, for money due him & responsibilities
assumed is my largest creditor, & it is right and proper that he
should have the management of the funds to which he must
look for remuneration It pains me to feel that it is not in my
my[sic] power to make to my children & grandchildren any token
remembrance, I consider all my property as belonging to my
creditors ---

    I owe my daughter Sally, a large sum of money Dr. Strud
wick knows all about it after paying all my other debts
there should any thing remains, I know she will not be oppo
-sed to it being devoted to the use of her mother during the short
remnant of her days ~

    I have nothing to leave to my dear children & grand
-children but a fathers blessing - May God bless them all, pros
per them in this life & prepare each one for a gracious entry into
life eternal, where I trust I shall meet each & not one be found
missing
