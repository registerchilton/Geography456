Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume E, pages 245-247
Recorded Feb 1831

The name "Thomas Clancy" is clearly written in the loose will.  The will book copy appears to be Thomas Clency"

Estate Papers comprise 78 pages and are found in a folder labeled "O'Ferrill, Barnabas (1831)".  Samuel Child was appointed administrator.

Testator's sister, Jane Woods, is wife of Charles Wood.
Ann or Anne Kelly is listed as "Ann Maria Kelly" in estate papers.  She married Jeremiah Bannon.

Inventory taken July 1831 lists "negro Titus & Rose"

The testator's name is listed in the estate papers with the title of "Doct.", and he seems to have not had a farm or plantation, rather his real estate was primarily a number of lots in the town of Hillsborough.

During the Estate Sale of 9 Jly 1838, "Negro man Titus" sold for $175.00 to N. O'Fairhill - perhaps the widow Nancy?

"1 Negro Woman", perhaps Rose, sold for 40.33 to Wm Faucett.
