Additional Comments:
This loose will is not recorded in any will book of Orange County.

Estate Papers seem to correspond to a folder labeled "Phillips, William (1821)", and contains a statement about the testator's widow being of extreme age and unable to care for herself being non compons mentis.

There is an "Articles of Agreement" recorded in Will Book Volume B, page 59 between William Galbreath and William Phillips, neighbors, agreeing to develop land on their shared border between their lands.
