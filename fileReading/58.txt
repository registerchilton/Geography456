Will of David Ray - 31 Jul 1821

I David Ray of Orange County do make & ordain this paper
writing as my last Will & Testament. ~~

I direct all my just debts to be paid out of my personal estate.

I give & devise to my wife Jane during the term of her natural
life Five hundred and twenty four acres of land where
I live, which is composed of the whole of the lands which I
got from the Estate of my father & grand-father & also of a
small tract adjoining the other two & containing seventy four
acres which I purchased from William McBroom - I also
give to my Wife, in absolute right, all my house hold & kitch
en furniture & utensils, my carriage & harness & a pair of
horses out of my stock, all the stock of family provisions on
hand & a sufficient quantity of Corn, wheat & flour, in the
discretion of my Executor, for the support of herself & her
family for one year. ~~ I also devise to my brother Robert
Ray the tract of land which I purchased from John McCal
-lock in the piney woods containing Two hundred acres
during the Term of his Natural life; but he is not to be at
liberty to clear more land than he & his own hands cultivate
nor to sell timber from the land:~~ Having already con
-veyed to my son Peter the land which I purchased from Per
-kins, I consider him fully advanced out of my real Estate.

To my sons Griffin, George, & Tyree, I give & devise all the
balance of my lands, including the lands given to my wife &
my brother during life, to have & hold the same, wheresoever
situate, to them & their heirs forever & to be divided when Griffith
shall come of age - excepting nevertheless, the land which
I purchased from Mr. Cameron & which I shall otherwise
dispose of in this will. -- And I further will & devise, that if
either or any of my said three sons Griffin, George & Tyree
should die before he or they shall arrive at full age &
without leaving issue living at the time or times or his
or their death, the share or shares of him of them so dying, of
& in the said lands, as well the survived[sic] as the original shares
shall remain & belong to the survivors or survivor of ["those" x-out]
those three sons. ~~ And after the payment of my debts &
exclusive of what I have already given to her in this will, I give
to my wife one ninth part of my whole personal property,
money & debts due to me & as a part of her share. I give her my
servants Yellow Nancy & Sally, at the valuation of my
Executors. -- And after the said Share of my wife shall have
been allotted to her, I direct that my Daughters shall each
                                                    (receive

[page 2]
receive, ["each of them" x-out] the sum of one thousand dollars out of my personal estate, tow-
-ards a satisfaction for the real estate which I have given to my
sons. ~~ And as to the residue of the pers[on]al estate, after the pay
-ment of my debts & the legacies to my wife & daughters. I will & di
-rect that the same be divided into Eight equal parts, where
-of I give one equal share or eighth part of each of my chil
-dren here named viz. Peter, Ellen, Griffin, George, Petronilla,
Peggy Jane, & Tyree: and as I have put into the possession of my
Son Peter & William B Jamison, the husband of my daughter
Ellen, certain slaves & have never conveyed or intended to con
-vey them, but have retained the title in myself. My will
in relation thereto furthermore is that all the said slaves
& their increase to the time of my death be reckoned parts
of my personal estate & that they be kept by my said Son
& my said daughter Peter & Ellen as part of their share of my
said Estate, at the valuation of my Executors; And it is also
my will, that in making the division of my land among my
sons & of my personal Estate among my wife & children.
that no resort to be had to any Court of Justice, but that my
Trustees & Executors hereafter named shall make the
said division themselves, as they may think right & pro
-per, having regard, in their discretion, to keeping the slaves
in families & the convenience of my wife & the equality
of division, in point of value according to the judgment of
My Executors. ~~~ Further my will is & I hereby give
devise & bequeath to my friends Duncan Cameron, James
Webb & Thomas Ruffin the Tract of land whereon my Son
William lives & which I purchased from Mr Cameron, situate
on Little River & containing three hundred & ninety three
acres more or less. To have & to hold to them & their heirs for
-ever; & also the remaining Eighth part of my personal
Estate, to them & their Executors forever: In Trust never
=theless & to the intent & meaning that they shall receive
annually the rents hires & profits of the said land & per
-sonal Estate including said Slaves & their increase & ap
-ply the same to the use & benefit of my said Son William
as an annual support during his natural life; but
the same, that is to say, within the said land & personal Es=
-tate, nor the hires, rents & profits shall be subject to the pay
ment of the debts of said Son nor liable to be sold or assigned
by him; And also, if owing to the habits of any said Son, it
shall seem right & proper in the opinion of my said Trustees
that all the said rents & profits should not be applied to the

[page 3]
use of my said Son, but that a part thereof should be disposed of for the
sapport[sic] & education of his family & Children, then & in that case
my said Trustees are fully authorized & impowered to expend
such part of the said hires, profits & rents to the sapport of my
wife & the Education & maintenance of the Children of my

Trust, upon the death of my said Son William to convey
& assure the whole of the said last mentioned Tract of land &

thereof them unexpended to the child or children which
my said Son shall leave then living: ~~ I also ap-
-point my said friends Duncan Cameron, James Webb
& Thomas Ruffin the guardians of all my Infant Chil
-dren, hereby giving to them authority, if they shall think
it best, to dispose of any of the Slaves belonging to them
whose conduct may render it proper to sell them & to
purchase slaves also for the Children ~~~   ~~~   It is fur
-ther my will that ["in case of" x-out] upon the Death of one or more of
