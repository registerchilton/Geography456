Recorded Aug 1847

Estate Papers comprise 52 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Glass, Stephen (1847)".  Testator's widow entered a caveat to dispute the will and to allot dower lands and support.  No executor was specified in this will, so a Writ of Procedendo was issued 25 Sep 1847 to qualify James A Craig as Executor.  An additional caveat was entered the 4th Monday (the 23rd) of August 1847 by the heirs, namely William Glass, Stephen F. Glass, Elizabeth R Glass, Margaret E Glass, James A Glass, & Levi H McClean with Mary C. his wife.  James A. Glass was still a minor at that time.
