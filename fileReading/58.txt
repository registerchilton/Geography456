Estate Papers comprise 57 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Hall, William (1827)". Alexander Hall was made administrator of the estate on 25 Aug 1825 with the a $5,000 bond.  It appears that Jesse Miller ended up administering it, however. On 28 Jan 1827 A plea of detinue by Jesse Miller, Admr. of the estate against Alexander Hall, detained one negro man slave of the name of Jesse of the value of one thousand dollars. Due to insufficient funds to settle the estate a petition to sell slaves was submitted to the Court of Pleas and Quarter Sessions, dated Nov 1827.
