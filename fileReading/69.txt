Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume D, pages 575-577
Recorded May 1820

Name of the Wife of the testator listed at Furby here could be Fereby, or Turley, perhaps?

Estate Papers comprise 53 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Graves, Jacob (1820)". Inventory lists "one negro girl", perhaps the girl Rainey mentioned in the will.  Mary Graves married George Glass, Catherine Graves married Philip Glass, Sally married David Isley, Mille married John Niece/Nease. Testator was "in his seventy fourth year when he died.", per petition dated 7 Feb 1821, he died "April last", thus April 1820.

A second estate sale was held Nov 1832, "after the death of the old woman.  At this sale, John Graves purchased "1 Nigro Woman" for $353.50, again, perhaps the girl Rainey listed in the will.

Bastion Graves in the will is mentioned as Boston Graves in the estate papers.
