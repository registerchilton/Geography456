Will of Catlett Campbell - 11 Jan 1845

    I Catlett Campbell of the County of Orange and
State of North Carolina, being of sound mind and
disposing memory do make public and declare this to
be my last will and testament -

1 In the first place I direct all my just debts to be
paid, & for this purpose that my executors shall sell all
of my lands their improvements and appurtenances,
My negro woman Beccy and her two children James[Jenny? Jerry?]
and Lewis, together with all my perishable property and
effects and the proceeds of the sale added to the debts
due to me will constitute a fund in my judgment amply
sufficient to meet all of my engagements.

2 Having no immediate family of my own to take the
rest of my negroes, fifteen in number, and it being im-
practical to divide them among my nearest relatives
without separating parents and children, I feel much
anxiety about the disposition which I feel compelled to make
of them. I do therefore most earnestly enjoin it upon my ex-
ecutors to sell them to good & kind masters, of their own
choice, who will purchase them for their own use, as it
is my belief that they will be better off with good
masters than in any other situation in which I can
place them. And I do more especially wish that War-
ter[?] & his wife Nancy and their nine children may be
thus disposed of without being separated. And if it not a-
gainst the laws of Virginia & the negroes should prefer it, it is
my wish that they should be owned and permanently held by
someone of my own Kindred in Virginia. It is my wish that
my friend Dr James Webb should have the refusal of Frank
the blacksmith at a fair price.

3 I will and direct that all the money arising from the
sales of my estate as here directed (after the payment of
my debts) together with all the rest and residue of my
estate shall be divided into five equal parts. Of which
sum I give and bequeath one fifth part to the children

[page 2]
of my deceased sister Mary Ann Burke, who may be living
at the time of my death. One other fifth part thereof I
give and bequeath to my sister Nancy Maleny[Maloney] and if
she shall be dead at the time of my death then that por-
tion to her then living children. One other fifth part thereof
I will and bequeath to my sister Sally Turner and if
she should not be living at the time of my death, then I give
and bequeath this portion to her living children at my death
And the other two fifths parts thereof I give and be-
queath unto my nephew James Burke of Allegany County
Virginia in trust one share of it for the sole and separate
use of my sister Permelia Waugh during her natural
life and at her death for the use & benefit of her living chil-
dren, but during her life to be free from the control of
her husband & not be liable for his debts or contracts.
And the other share or fifth part to be held by him for the
sole and separate use & benefit of my sister Judy McGin-
nis during her natural life free from the control of her
husband & of all liability for his debts or contracts and at
her death for the use and benefit of her children who may
survive her. And if any of my said sisters shall be dead
at the time of my death without leaving any surviving
children, then the share intended for her shall go to her
living sisters, and the children of her deceased sisters such
children taking the share of & representing their mothers. My
intention being that my sisters and their children shall have
the whole surplus of my estate after the payment of debts
& the costs of administration.

4th There are now living I think seven negroes, viz., Dicy,
& Emilines two children, and Harriet and her three children
who were willed by the late Dr John Umstead to my friend Thom
as D. Bennehan and myself to be liberated; at the time of his
death that could not be affected; perhaps under the present
laws of the state upon that subject, it may be done; and
I do most earnestly entreat Mr. Bennehan (if in his power) to per-

[page 3]
form the trust thus confided to us, by our mutual friend
and I give to my executors full power to release any interest
which I may have in said negroes or their increase present & fu-
ture to Mr. Bennehan, to enable him to accomplish this purpose, if
such release is necessary - or to sell or convey them to any other
person or persons for a nominal price for the purpose of effec-
ting their freedom. As I do not desire that they should ever
be considered any part of my estate.

5th If any of my executors shall fail to qualify or act it is
my will and intention, that the acting executor shall
sell & convey my property according to the provisions of my
will & that such sales shall be private or public, for cash
or a credit, as under existing circumstances may be
deemed best.

6th I appoint my nephew James Burke, and my friends,
John U. Kirkland, Osmond F Long, and John W. Norwood executors
of this my last will & testament. Hereby revoking all other
wills made by me.

    Witness my hand & seal this the 11th day of Jan-
