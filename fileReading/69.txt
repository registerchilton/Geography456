Note 1: "furnitud" seems very strange, but is found in other wills of this era have this same spelling.

Estate Papers comprise 21 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Fossett, John (1798)".  Testator died "on or about the first day of April 1797", leaving two childen Thomas and Mary, both infants under the age of 21 years with Morgan Hart as guardian.

Negroes named Jane and Betsey are metioned and were appraised by William Lytle and Wm. Strayhorn to be worth Â£140, although it isn't clear whether they were sold or if the Testator's widow kept them.
