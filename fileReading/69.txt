Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume H, page 8
Recorded 7 Jun 1869

In the same folder as the loose will, there is an Application for Letters Testamentary dated 7 June 1869, with Malinda Marcom as Executrix and listing heirs as:
John Marcom, Aaron Marcom, Spencer Marcom, Mary Soren, Syntha Marshall, heirs of Betsey Holder (if any) the heirs of Willie Marcom & the heirs of William Marcom.

Estate Papers comprise 11 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Marcom, Willis (1869)". Executrix was Malinda Marcom.  There is a paper from the estate of William Markham with a sale dated 28 Dec 1854 with Willis R. Markham as Administrator, so this was misfiled.  Is the administrator in this estate paper the same person as the testator of the above will?  These estate papers also contain a Petition to Sell Slaves, naming them.  There does not seem to be any names of the purchasers, however.

The few pages in this folder do indeed pertain to this testator.  The estate was settled in 1869, after the emancipation. No family history found in them.
