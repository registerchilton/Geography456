Recorded Feb 1837

Estate Papers comprise 89 pages and are found in folder labeled "Freeland, Joseph (1843)".  Many pages of guardian accounts.  This might be of interest for family history. Also legatees filed complaints against the executor claiming that he had not made the distributions specified in the will, etc. Joseph Freeland "departed this life in the latter part of the year 1836"

Wife's name not stated in will, but mentioned in the estate papers as Lydia Freeland, widow of Joseph Freeland.
