Not exactly clear whether the testator's signature includes "Senr" at the end of the original will, and the will book copy does not include this.

Note 1: These are the children of S S Lloyd, not the names of the slaves being bequeathed.

Estate papers: Testator's son Stephen S. Lloyd died intestate in June 1861.  His estate papers comprise 109 pages and are filed under "Lloyd, Stephen S (1861)"  An undated folder is also labeled "Lloyd, Stephen S", which refers to "Faucett, John M (1869)".  There is no such folder, but there is a folder labeled "Faucett, John M (1863)" which is comprised of 168 pages.  This is because Stephen S. Lloyd (son of the testator) married Caroline Faucett.
