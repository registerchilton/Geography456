Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume D, pages 567-568
Recorded Feb 1820

Will book copy has wife's name as Jennet.  Here it is spelled two ways and looks more like Jannet or Janet

Will book copy has signature of Junia Hall as a witness, but this name does not appear on the loose will.

Perhaps the person who wrote the will put a few too many dots over letters that weren't "i" ? (Ecclis and testamint)

No estate papers found.
