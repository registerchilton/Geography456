Additional Comments:

This loose will was found in the NC State Archives, CR 073.801.  Transcription from photocopy in my collection. It does not seem to have been included in the filming and was not found on-line.

This is nearly word-for-word the same as the wills of Arrena Latta and Amelia Latta - written in the same handwriting, same date.

No estate papers found.
