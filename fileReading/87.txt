business: Whether the terms of the said copartnership
ever were reduced to writing or not, your Orators and
Oratrixes do not know the precise terms thereof
they can not therefore set forth: but they have always

though he took the deed from John Waggoner in
his own name, held it together with the mill erected
thereon as well to the benifit of the said Stephen
Smith as his own.  The purchase money therefor &
