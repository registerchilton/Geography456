Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume F, pages 271-273
Recorded Feb 1846

Note: The number of "Negroes Nine in Number" do not seem to be nine, so there is something wrong with the way this is written or the way I interpreted it.

CAVEAT: There are two wills for Joseph Armstrong written in 1839. This one in a (will) folder labeled "Armstrong, Joseph 1846", refers to a wife Nancy and proved Feb 1846. The other is in a (will) folder labeled "Armstrong, Joseph 1839" and refers to wife Peggy, will proved Nov 1840.

Estate papers comprise three pages and are found in a folder "Armstrong, Joseph (1847)".  Addtionally the folder of estate papers labeled "Armstrong, Joseph" (not dated) of six pages was searched. Those papers were submitted by the executors of the Joseph Armstrong estate probated in 1840.
