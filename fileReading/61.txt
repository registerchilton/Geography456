James Webb agent &c     }
     vs                 } Sci: fa:
John Lee & Sullivan Lee }

        These defendants for answer to the allegations
contained in the sci: fa: served on them say that [they] are
the Executors appointed & qualified to the last
Will & Testament of John Lee decd. that under the
said Will, John Garrard was entitled to receive
from them a part of the estate of the said
John Lea deceased somewhere about Three
hundred dollars as the husband of Nancy one
of the daughters & legatees of the said John
Lee decd. That at the sale of the property of
the estate of the said deceased one Herbert
Sims informed them that he had purchased
the interest of the said John Garrard, and had
a transfer or conveyance for the same -

    That said Sims purchased a negro
Girl at the said sale for the sum of Three
hundred & Eighty dollars or thereabouts
That upon a settlement with the said SIms
these defendants honestly & without intention of
fraud ["took" x-out] gave up to said Sims his bond for
the purchase money of said slave, & took his
bond for the excess of $300- thereby paying said
Sims $300 which these defendant then supposed
from the best calculation they could make was
about the sum due ["to said" x-out] from[?] said Garrards
legacy. - That owing to difficulties in which
the estate is involved these defendants have been
unable as yet to bring to a close the affairs
thereof, but from revelations made subsequent
to the payt of sd. $300 to said Sims they believe
that they have paid more than was rightfully
due, that they have taken the receipt of the
said Garrard for the same ---

[page 2]

That they have not in their possession either upon
secret trust, delivery or otherwise any property
or estate of the said Garrard to hold in trust
for him or any other person or persons to the
best of their Knowledge, except upon the final
settlement of sd. Estate, there may be a small
balance due which in fact they do not believe.
