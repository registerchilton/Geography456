Recorded Feb 1836

The surname is clearly written "Moon" in most places, but could be interpreted as "Moore" in some places.  However the names of the various relatives mentioned line up with the Moore family.

This is written in the same handwriting as the will of James Moore (1836), and based on the signatures appears to be by Jesse O'Daniel
