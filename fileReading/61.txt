of Wm. Jamison      } Evidence for the defen-
dants

John Ray -- Mrs Jamison said She cou[l]d not raise
the children without buying the negroes. I understood
she purchased them for herself, and I never under
stood to the contrary till this Suit was brot & talked of she gave
what I tho't was a full and fair price for them -
the children were very young - I would not have given
more for them - indeed I have rather not have
 had them at that price & would not have given so much for them - She only intended to
use their labor for raising the children, not to
hold them for the children to be divided among
them as their property -- She gave her own Bond
and security for the purchase of the negroes ---
I don't know whether they would he sold for
more when separated or not ---

I told her that the things much be sold for their
full Value -- that no mean should be used
to sell the property at an under-value - She
said that was her wish, and that she [did] not in
tend to take one shilling from the Estate, but
at its' full value --- If I had seen any impro
per means used to sell the property at an under
value, I should have prevented it -- I told the
People to bid for the property, and not to omit
doing so from a desire to suffer her to purchase
at an under value, as I was determined
she shou[l]d pay as much as any one else ---
except as to the crop, which I tho't she ought
to have a Cow the purchase of $65 or £6 - but she used no means to have it
                                                           sold low

[page 2]
John Cain -- I went there to bid for negroes
and bid for all that were sold -- when they
went as high as I tho't they were worth I stop
ped - it is true that I bid more for the ne-
groes that Farmer bo't than I tho't they were
worth --- I did not stop bidding for the
negroes which Mrs. Jamison purchased
because she was a bidder, I bid just as
much as if she had not been a Bidder
-- the Negroes sold for their full value ---
and I saw no means used by Mrs Jamison
to cause the property to be sold at an un
der value --- other persons bid for the
negroes which I bid for ---

William Cain - I tho't the negroes sold
low but saw no means used by Mrs.
Jamison to prevent the people
from buying

                  Jane Jamison, William Jamison, and Robert Jamison,
                  Infant Orphans under the age of twenty one
                  years by the said John Jamison their next Friend
                  and Guardian, against Samuel Riggs and
                  Jane his wife ["and John Robinson and Rachael" x-out]
                  ["his wife ---" x-out]

                             Sheweth unto your worships that
William Jamison late of the County of Orange aforesaid, being
possessed of a large personal estate, consisting of Negroes
Horses, Cattle, furniture, debts due to him and other things,
died Intestate, in or about the month of October in the
year 1793 --- ---, having Jane we of the Defendants his
widow and Relict, and the said Rachael Robinson, and
Margaret, John, Mary, Jane, William and Robert Jamison
his Children and next of kin. --- That administration of the
estate of the said William Jamison deceased was granted
so his widow the said Jane and John Ray Esquire ---
at a Courth held for the said County on the fourth
Monday of November in the year 1793 --- ; and the
said Administrators afterwords, towit, on or about the
15th day of January in the year 1794 - proceeded
to sell at public sale the personal estate of the said
William Jamison deceased, or the greater part thereof,
and did then sell or pretend the same; and your Petitioners
alledge[sic] that part of the said estate so set up to
be sold, consisted of four Negroes, towit, a little Woman by
the name of Flora about twenty six year of age; a very
likely boy, her Child, by the name of Sam, about twelve
years of age; a very like Girl, her Child, by the name of Nan

[page 2]
seven years of age, and a very likely Boy, about eighteen
months old, by the name of Abram, --   --   --   --   --
which said Negreos were at the time of the value of
£350 -  -  -  -; and that the said Jane improperly and
illegally with intent to bid the same off at an under
value, cause all the said Negroes to be set up for
sale in one Lott; or cause the said Negroes to be so
set up in one Lott for the purpose and intent
of bid[d]ing them off to the use of herself and Children
although several persons present who wished to bid for
the said Negroes seperately[sic], objected to that manner
of sale; and that the said Jane having caused
the said Negroes to be so set up, did complain
of them who bid for them, and affirm that she
was bid[d] them off for herself and Children
and thereby prevented others from bid[d]ing -  -  -  -  -
and did by herself or some other person, bid
off all the said Negroes at the small and
inferior value of £230:0:6    although they were
then well worth the sum of £350 -  -  - as aforesaid:
and your Petitioners contends that notwithstanding
the said pretended sale of the said Negroes, the title
and property in them was not changed, and that
the said Samuel Riggs and Jane his wife
hold the said Negroes and the after Increase of the
said Flora as the property of the said William
Jamison deceased subject to a division; And say
that if the said Jane intended to purchase the
said Negroes to her own use, her xxxxxx was
illegal and fraudulent, and the said pretended
sale void and that if she intend to purchase
them to the use of herself and Children, no
rights were thereby changed, and therefore the trans=
action void.  And your Petitioners also alledge that

[page 3]
the said Flora, and? the said Sale has had three
Children, a boy by the name of Oliver, a girl by
the name of Celia, and another Girl by the name
of Phillis, and that all the aforesaid Negroes
are still living ------
    Your Petition further shew that the said
Administrators sold at the sale aforesaid, property
of the estate of the sd. William Jamison declared,
to the amount of £1099.11.4 exclusive of the said
Negroes; and that the said Administrator collected
of the debts due to the said Intestate in his lifetime
£500 or some other large sum ----
    Your Petitioners further shew that at
a Court held for the said County on the fourth
Monday of February 1795, the said Jane, now
Jane Riggs was appointed guardian of all
the aforesaid Children of the said Wm. Jamison
deceased, and took on herself the care of
their estates; and being so appointed Guardian
titled with and received of the said John
Ray the other Administrator, and the estate of
the said Intestate which had been in his hands,
and released and discharged the said
John Ray of and from the same; and
also titled[?] with and paid to the said John
Robinson now of the state of Tennessee the share of Rachael his wife and
took a discharge of the same. And the said
Jane afterward, towit, in or about the year

married, have held possession of the lands of your

[page 4]

have enjoyed the Project thereof, which were of the
yearly volume of £40 or there abouts; and have
also possessed and enjoyed the profits of the
said Negroes of the yearly value of £30 or some
other large sum --- And that the said
Samuel and Jane have not, nor hath
either of them rendered any account whatever
of the said Administration or Guardianship
    And your Petitioners further shew that
they are of the following ages, Margaret 22
years - John 21 years - Mary 19 years - James 15
years - William 12 years, and Robert nine years;
and that they and each of this have indus=
=triously worked and labored, ever since they

                            The joint Answer of Samuel Riggs
and Wife to the Petiton of Margaret Jamison & John Jamison
of full age, and Mary Jamison, Jane Jamison, William Jamison,
and Robert Jamison Infant Orphans under the Age of 21 yearly
the said John Jamison their next friend & Guardian ----
                            These defendants saving reserving
&c for answer say - that it is true William Jamison in the
petition named died possessed of personal Estate in the year 1793
leaving the defendant Jane Riggs his widow, and the Petitioners
above named together with Rachel Robertson her children and next of
kin to the said William Jamison who died intestate -- it is also
true that Administration on the estate of the said William was granted
by Orange County Court to John Ray and the defendant Jane
who according to law & to the order granted by the Court aforesaid
sold all the personal Estate of the said William without reserve
--- The defendant Jane Riggs positive denies that she caused
the Negroes Flora and her Children Sam, Nan & Abram to be set
up in one Lott for the purpose of cause an advantage or Benefit
to arise to herself or with any View to injure the Estate of said Willi
am - but the same was done by the join advice, direction & consent
of John Ray the other Administrator, for the purpose of indulging the
reasonable & natural desire of the Negro Flora, that she should not
be separated from her said Children ---- the said Jane Riggs
doth further positive deny that She bought the said Negroes at the
Sale aforesaid, for the purpose stated in the petition, but expressly al
ledges, that She purchased them for and on her own Account, separate
and in dependent of the Interest of other Persons, & no otherwise what
soever - that several Persons bid against her for the said Negroes
and that the price at which She purchased them, was at that time
fair, and adequate to the value of said Negroes ---
---- These defendants admit that Jane Riggs did receive of
John Ray the other Administrator the Sum of Thirteen Hundred
and twenty - Nine pounds 11/10 (£1329.11-10) currency, which

[page 2]
Sum was paid in Bonds taken for the personal estate of Said
William Jamison by said John Ray, and included a
Bond given by the defendant Jane Riggs for purchases made
by herself at said Sale, including said Negroes, and that the
said Jane Riggs did also receive in 1799 from the Clerk
of Hillsboro' Sup: Court the Sum of Two Hundred and forty -
seven pounds - 0/3- (£247.6.8) amount of a Judgment re
covered again James Glasgow, making in the whole the Sum
of One Thousand five Hundred and Seventy Six pounds - 18/6
and no more - This sum these defendants allege must
according to the statute for distributing Intestate estate, be e
qually divided among the defendant Jane Riggs and her
children the Petitioners and Rachel Robinson, which will afford
to each & every one of the the Sum of One Hundred & ninety se
ven pounds - 2-3-(£197-2-3) - The defendants have paid
the amount of this distributive share to John Robinson and
Rachal his wife, and to he Petitioner Margaret they have paid
the Sum of One hundred & forty pounds part of her distributive
share --
                         These defendants say that no profits
have been received by them from the lands of the Petitioners - that
the dower of the defendant Jane embraces all the cleared land
and Improvement belonging to the real Estate of said William
Jamison decd. and that the residue is uncleared & unproduc
tive ---- they further say that the work and labour of the
Petitioners is by no means a Compensation for the trouble
and care which has been borne by the defendant Jane
and her Husband the said Samuel in boarding maintain
ing, cloathing and schooling the Petitioner from the death of the
said William Jamison up to the time of filing their petition
being a period of ten (10) years --- that the Interest on the
aforesaid Sum of £1578-18/7, amounts for the aforesaid period
to the sum of £737-16-8 - which sum these defendants hum
bly conceive[?] will but very modestly compensate them for the
Boarding, cloathing, and schooling of the Petitioners, and

[page 3]
will amount to no more than an annual charge of £10-10.6 against
each of the Petitioners, which these defendants hope to be allowed
in addition to the usual allowance made to Administrators &
Guardians for care trouble & residue[?] in managing Intestate and
Orphan's estates ---
                    These defendants are advised that the State
ment which they have made in this their Answer relative to the estate
of William Jamison decd. precludes the necessity of stating an annual
account, which however they submit to do if required thereto by the
Court ---- they are will and always have been so to pay to the
Petitioners their just distributive Shares, but which they have reused
to receive except on their own terms, to which these defendants cou[l]d
not in justice to themselves agree to ----
                    These defendants having answered
all the material parts of these Petitioners petition, pray to be dismissed

would have been charged annually with Interest

had previously accrued; which charge is not made
in the account above stated - But as the Defendants

to the Defendants for their expense and trouble in
the said Administration, and Guardianships;
the Court is of the opinion, and so adjud[g]e that the
Defendant be allowed nothing more for

Issuing from the County Court of Orange to us directed
& other Plaintiffs and Samuel Riggs & Wife Defen-
-dent ["at the House of James Walker" x-out] - We proceeded

the Estate of William Jamison decd by Mrs. Jamison
as Administratrix of said Estate, who is now the Wife
of Samuel Riggs - at which sale four Negroes
viz Flora & her three Children were exposed to
sale in one Lot - that several persons present
expressed a wish that they should be sold
separately, but Mrs. Jamison the widow, insisted
on selling them together as they were of one family
and was a bidder for them, and informed the
Bystanders that she was bidding for the benefit
of herself & the children which this deponent
believes had the effect to prevent people from
bidding for the negroes --

Question by John Jamison - Did the Negroes sell
for their value or near it in your opinion Answer
the sold for something upward of four hundred
dollars, but in my opinion much below their value
What do you think was the value of these Negroes
in your Judgment? Answer I think they were
worth at least six hundred & fifty dollars -
Question - Do you think they would have sold

[page 2]
for more money had they been set up separately, and
had the widow sayd nothing to dissuade or prevent
people from bidding? Answer. If the Widow had
said nothing, and if the Negroes had been sold seperately[sic]
I fully believe they would have raised the sum I have
estimated as their worth worth viz Six hundred & fifty dollars

- Do you know anything of the present value of the
said Negroes ? Answer not having seen them
lately - I cannot say any thing certainly of their
present value - Sworn to before us at the

-gelists of Almighty God Deposeth & Saith -
That he was present at the sale of the Estate of William

The Deposition of John Neely of lawful age who
being duly sworn upon the holy Evangelists of Almighty
God Deposeth as follows - That he also was present
at the Sale of the Effects of Wm. Jamison decd. And
that when Flora & her 3 children Sams or Samson, Nan & Abram
were exposed to sale which by the direction of the Widow
were set up in one Lot- She the said Widow said that
she did not know how she could raise her Children
without them - that in consequence of what she
said there publickly[sic] he believes people who other-
-wise would have been bidders were prevented
from bidding, from tenderness or sympathy for
Her situation as a Widow with Children ---
That the Negroes sold for something upwards of four
hundred dollars a sum which this deponent thinks
was much below their real value, And he believes
they would have sold much better had they been
sold seperately -- I think the Negroes were worth
at the time of the sale not less than Six hundred &
twenty two dollars - And with the additional in-
-crease viz Oliver & two others the youngest of whom
is now 2 of 3 years old now[?] worth fourteen or fifteen
hundred dollars -- This deponent further says
that the Land which has been cultivated since
the death of Wm. Jamison over and above
what has been allotted at the Widows dower
is worth to the best of his Judgment fifty
dollars yearly -- This deponent also says that
he have been well acquainted with the family
of the deceased Wm. Jamison, that they have always
worked upon the said plantation & in the Crop

[page 4]
that he left three sons & three daughters, viz John who
was about 12 yrs old at this Fathers death, Margaret, abt
15 years old, Mary about 8 or 9 years old, Jean, about
6 yrs old, William about 3 yrs old - and Robert
who was not born at his Father decease --
that the Children have general been cloathed[sic] in
a neighbourlike manner - and have generally been
employed as soon as they were able in the Crop
And in his belief they have been worth much
more than the expense of maintainance[sic]

decd. and remembers that when the Negroes Flora
and her three Children were offered for sale in
one Lot - Old Mrs. Ray objected to their being
sold in that manner & said that if offered to sale
singly they would sell higher that many one
would buy one who would not be able to
buy the whole - that the widow said she
wanted to buy said Negroes for herself & the
Children - that the Negroes ere accordingly sold
together & bid off by her at a sum as this
Deponent things below their value - viz about
four hundred & sixty dollars - that in his opinion
the Negroes were at the time of the sale worth
six hundred & forty or fifty dollars -- That with
                                           the

[page 5]
the additional increase (viz) Oliver, about Eight years old

years old the Negroes are now worth fourteen
hundred dollars -- The he was acquainted with
the Plantations of the last Wm. Jamison and
that the Lands that have been cultivated since
the death of the said Jamsion are worth to the
best of his belief fifty dollars annually
beside the Land allotted for dower---

This Deponent further says that he is acquainted
with the Children of the deceased William
Jamison - And upon the whole he believes
that their labour is upon an average fully
worth their Maintainance[sic] and Cloathing[sic]

The Deposition of William Hall of full age
who being duly sworn according to Law Deposeth
& saith - That he acted as Deputy Sheriff under
John Moss at the Sale of William Jamisons effects
that when the four Negroes Flora & her three Children
were offered for sale, viz Samson Nan & Abram
William Ray objected and said if there were sold
separately they would fetch more money, that
as the widow appeared desirous to purchase said
Negroes which she said she intended for the use
                                             of

[page 6]
of herself & the Children.  The Sheriff Mr Moss who was
present, said that he did not care for his Commissions
on the Sale & that as it was to favor the Widow
& Children he desired the deponent to know them
off to her bid; which this Deponent accordingly
Di the the price of Four hundred & sixty dollars
& six pence, which he say was in his opinion less
that their value, that he believes the Negroes
would have sold for seven hundred dollars, if
nothing had been said on the part of the widow
expressing her desire to keep them for herself & Children
& would himself have given that sum for them---
This deponent further says that since that period
The Wench Flora has had three children viz Oliver now about eight
years old and who is at this time worth about Two
hundred & fifty dollars, Celia about six years old & now
worth about one hundred & fifty dollars, and Phillis

the family of the said Jamison since his decease
that he believes that have been Cloathed in a decent
neighbourlike manner, and have been accustom
-ed to work on the Plantation, that their Labor
is fully equall to their Maintenance & Cloathing
except during the widowhood of Mrs. Jamison
when several of the Children were smaller &
during that time, he thinks the Rent of the
Lands not included in the Dower should be
allowed to the Widow - or in other word that

any rent -- Sworn to before us at the place
