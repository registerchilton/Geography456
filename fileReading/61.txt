Will Book Volume E, pages 103-105
Recorded Feb 1826

She directs that her body be buried in New Hope (Presbyterian) Meeting House, which is located in Chapel Hill, Orange County, North Carolina.  Find a Grave has a Mary Craig buried there, but with significant discrepancies.

Estate Papers comprise four pages and are found in a folder labeled "Craig, Mary (1826)". The main page is almost completely indecipherable, but appears to say something to the effect that it is an "inventory" without listing any items except that the estate is indebted some $2600, recorded Aug 1826.  Perhaps more detail is to be had wherever this is recorded.
