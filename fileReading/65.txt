to his death his mind was very weak and I considered
and believe that he had not - a disposing mind nor
was he qualified to transact his own Business that -
during the time I lived with him he frequently would
not know me and would call me by another name
and that - during this time he would frequently not
know his nearest - neighbors. And that - once in particu=
lar a near neighbor of his by the name of John Christ=
mas came over to procure some seed corn and that
my grand father did not know him but that after
Christmas had gone away from Gran father inquired
of my if he was not Daniel Cloud who was also
another near neighbor of his

Question 5th Do you or not know of your Grand
-Father Palmer's having made several wills
previous to his death; if yea state how
many - If he made any state how long
before his death it was that he made
his last?

Answer the Question 5th I have heard that he had made several
Wills before I went to live with him but I do not know
of my own knowledge that such was the fact; he made
the Will which had since his death been recorded as his

[page 3]
last Will and testament whilst - I lived with him and
about three or four months after I commenced with
him.

Question 6th At What time did the circumstance
which you relate about your Grand-Father's
not know John Christmas from Daniel
Cloud occur was it before or after the
last will of which you also speak was
made?

Answer to Question 6th The circumstance above related took
place a very short-time before the execution of the
last Will and Testament. And further this de=
fendant saith not
                         William Palmer

which said will among other things the said testator
devised & bequeathed as follows, viz, "To my friend

Jacob, Patt, Cynthia (the one formerly owned by

and upon the death of my said daughters Nancy
Clancy I give and bequeath the said negroes
together with their present and future increase

with their said increase at the death of the said
Nancy Equally among her children, and if any
of them be dead leaving lawful issue, then
such issue to stand in the place & represent
their parent." The said negroes after the death of
the testator Martin Palmer were allowed to remain
in the possession of the said Nancy Clancy who sold
one or more of them and vested the proceeds or a part
thereof in the purchase from said William Huntington of some real estate in the
Town of Hillsborough consisting of a part of lot
Nos 23 and 24 with the improvements therein, &
the said Huntington having removed from the State

Court to convey the said House & lot and all the
negroes which had been bequeath to him in trusts

[page 3]
as aforesaid to some other trustee to be appointed
by said Court, to be held by the new trustee upon the
same trusts as where declared & appointed by the said
will of Martin Palmer deceased; and such proceed=
ing were had in the said cause that at the Septem=
ber Term for year 1839 of said Court decree was
made accordingly, and the defendant James M. Palm=
er was by the said Court appointed a trustee for the
purposes aforesaid in the place of the said Huntington
and by decree bearing date the 27th day of September
1838 the said Huntington did convey the said negroes
& the said real estate to said Palmer upon the same
trusts and limitations as are mentioned and de=
clared in the said will of Martin Palmer deceased.

(++)
Copies of which said Will deed and suit in Equi=[ty?]
are in the possession of the complainants, are referred
to by them for greater Certainty, and will be
produced to the Court whenever required

    The Complainants further shew that the said
Thomas Clancy died in the year 1844 and the said
Nancy Clancy in ["year 184" x-out] the spring of the present
year and that no direction was every given by them
or either during their lives or by any will or other ap=
pointments to operate after their death of the mode
by which the property held under the said clause
of Martin Palmer's will should be divided among the
Children ["and" x-out] of said Nancy Clancy & their de=
scendants, so that by the said will the said proper=
ty both real and personal as the complainants are
advised passes to the children of said Nancy Clan=
cy and their descendants to be equally divided
between them : And the complainants shew
that the said Nancy Clancy at her death left
surviving her only two children Elizabeth the wife
of the Complainant C N. B. Evans, and Mary
the wife of James R. Callum, and one grand
child, the Complainant Thomas Young the only
child of Levi Young who married Sarah another
daughter of said Nancy Clancy who died
in the life time of her mother.

[page 4]
The Complainant further shew unto your Honor
that in the year 1845 Jane Clancy
another daughter of Nancy Clancy who died before her Mother became indebted
to the Bank of Cape Fear at Hillsborough by note for
the sum of $150 which note was signed by James M.
Palmer trustee of Nancy Clancy & by others as sureties
by said James; that a judgment was obtained at
May Term 1845 ["aforesaid" x-out] of Orange County Court
upon said Note against James M Palmer Trustee
of Nancy Clancy and Lemuel Lynch being both
sureties for said Jane on the note & being the only
parties who had been served with process and
had appeared to said suit; that and[sic] execution
issued upon said Judgment in which said Palmer
was styled "Trustee of Nancy Clancy" The same
was levied upon the House & lots aforesaid in
the Town of Hillsborough and were sold by
the sheriff of Orange County on said execution at
August Court 1846 when the defendant William
Nelson became the purchaser of the same and
entered upon the possession thereof.

        The Complaints further shew unto your
Honor that as the defendant Palmer had signed
said note strictly and technically as trustee of
Nancy Clancy but her request, it was supposed
by her and by the complainants that her interest
in the said property and that only had passed
to said Nelson by virtue of said sale; and the
complainants were advised upon the death of the
said Nancy Clancy that the title of said Nelson
was then at an end that said property became
theirs by virtue of the will of Martin Palmer decd.
conformity to said will & the decree of the Court aforesaid
and acting upon this view of their right they
have since the death of Mrs Clancy called upon
the said Nelson & requested him to deliver to them

[page 5]
the said property, but now so it is may it please
you Honor the said Nelson utterly refuses to do so claims
to be the absolute owner in fee simple of said lots
by virtue of his said purchase freed from the trusts
settled upon it and of all right or interest of the
complainants or any of them to the same - And they
have also called upon the said Palmer to convey to them
the said property as by his duty as trustee he was
bound to do, but the said Palmer asserts that as
the said Nelson is in the actual possession of said property
claiming the same as his own and adversely to the
said Palmer, that no deed from him would
be of any avail to the complainants; which pre=
tence on the part of said Nelson is most iniquitous
and unjust for he well knew and had notice in
what manner the said property was held by said
Palmer & that the same was held by him only as trustee
and the Nancy Clancy had only a live interest
therein during her own life and that the complaint=
ants her children & grandchild ["had the" x-out] were en=
titled to the remainder therein in fee simple or
in some other manner: All of which actings and
doings of said Nelson are contrary to Equity & good
conscience &c To the end therefore that the said
William Nelson may by a decree of this court be
declared a trustee for the benefit of the Complainants
of said Lots and houses, & that He and said Palmer
may be decreed to convey the same and also such
other property as may be held by said Palmer as tru=
tee aforesaid to the complainants, that an account
may be taken of the profits of the said Houses and
lots since the death of Nancy Clancy and that

[page 6]
such other and further relief may be granted
unto them as to your Honor may seem meet: And
that the said Nelson & Palmer may upon their cor=
poral oaths full true and perfect answer make
to all the allegations contained in this bill in the
same manner as if they were repeated by inter=
rogatories, particularly that the said Nelson
may truly and particularly answer all that he
knew had heard at any time thought or suspected
with regard to the interest of the children of said Nancy
Clancy in the said House & Lots, whether he had
ever supposed that they had any interest and what
that interest was, and when he first became ac=
quainted with it or had any information or
notice thereof and whether he supposed at the sale
that he was purchasing any thing more than the life
interest of Nancy Clancy in said property:

May it please you Honor to grant unto your
orators & oratrixes the State's Writ of Subpoena
to be directed to said Nelson and Palmer com-
manding them to appear at the next term
of the Court of Equity to be held for Orange County
in Hillsborough on the 2nd Monday of September
Next then & there to answer &c & perform such
decree as may be made in the premises.

    And as in duty bound they will every pray &c
                                J. W. Norwood Sol
                                for Complainants
