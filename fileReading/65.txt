Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume F, pages 315-316
Recorded Nov 1846

Left edge of original bound with
conservator's tape, so the left quarter inch of the
will is harder to read.  The ink is somewhat faded.
Handwriting is good.

Nota Bene: Some transcribers who have only seen the Will Book copy, assert that the year was 1826, rather than 1846. Examining the surrounding will book, and the titles at the top of the pages therein, along with the original makes this unmistakably 1846 instead.

Estate Papers comprise nine pages and are found in a folder labeled "Dortch, Young (1846)."
