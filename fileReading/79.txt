-ing sufficient conveyances to such persons or their assigns
as shall under such Contracts or Agreements be intitled to the
same, in as full and ample manner as I could have

to my said Sisters and niece, the whole, or such part of the

unpaid according to the terms of my Agreement with ---
them, until it shall become expedient from the determina
-tion of the Contingency above alluded to, to discontinue ["the" x-out]
further payment, or otherwise they shall continue to make
payments agreeably to the terms of my said Compromise, un-
-til the whole sum shall be paid ----
