[Note: This valuation appears to have been created subsequent to the division requested by Benjamin D. Roberts and his wife Martha in order to divide the estate.  It is unclear whether writer was deliberate in the use of ditto marks and the word "Do".  It is most likely that the two persons (Henry and Africa) where "Mr Rogers" name appears are those who went to him, rather than all of the ditto marks, but the ditto marks also indicate the names of mothers, and it doesn't seem likely that Peggy was the mother of 16 persons, so perhaps she is the mother of 6 or 7 of those below Murchison?  See the original.]
