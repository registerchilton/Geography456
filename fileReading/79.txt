Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume D, pages 36-38
Recorded May 1801

After transcribing the Will Book copy of this will, it appeared that the original loose will was 1) Easier to read 2) More complete - there were several important omissions or mistakes made in creating the Will Book copy. 3) Better punctuation, while not necessarily punctuated to current norms, the various parentheses, semi-colons and commas used helped to emphasize the meaning of the phrases.

Estate Papers comprise 65 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Harris, Edward (1801)". Hire of negroes is frequently mentioned, but no names listed. Testator died in March 1801.  Willie James Harris "was about 2 years old at the death of his father", thus born 1799.  He was owned a negro about his same age - no name noticed inthe estate papers, but perhaps the negro boy given him in the will named Lewis.
