Additional Comments:

This will is not recorded in the will books - presumably due to the fact that it was not properly witnessed.

Estate papers comprise three pages and are found in a folder labeled "Lindsey, Jane (1816)".  This is the administrator bond, John Lindsey appointed.  The executors listed in the will were not assigned.
