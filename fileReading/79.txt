Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume D, pages 401-404
Recorded Feb 1814

Estate Papers comprise nine pages and are found in a folder labeled "Newlin, James (1814)".

Legatees each received $201.30 1/2:
Deborah Newlin
Deborah Newlin for M. Quakenbush
Ruth Carter
Hannah Farlow
Eleanor Guthrie
Deborah Zackery
Sarah Marshall

...totaling seven distributees.  Per the provisions of the will, the first Deborah seems to the be widow, the second line, "M. Quackenbush" aligns with Mary Newlin who married Peter Quackenbush, and it is not clear how she became a  distributee.
Ruth Newlin married John Carter
Hannah Newlin married Michael Farlow
Eleanor Newlin married Claiborne Guthrie
Deborah Newlin married Jonathan Zachary
Sarah Newlin married Joseph Marshall

This family seems to have been also associated with Alamance County, NC.
