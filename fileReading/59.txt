Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume F, pages 110-111
Recorded Nov 1841

Silas M. Link's name is found in many of these probate records.  The name being written as "Salast" or "Silast" is unusual.

Estate Papers comprise 22 pages and are found in a folder labeled "James, Jesse (1841)". James Latta renounced the rights to execute the estate.  Williamson Burton was appointed administrator in Jan 1841, and later moved to Tennessee, and legatees filed a motion to sell the land of the estate in spring of 1858.

Sally Rhods died leaving two children, Gilbert & Pleasant.  Milly Redmon died leaving a child named Polly.  Russel James died leaving five or six children.  There is probably additional relationship information to be deduced in these estate papers if a researcher is interested.
