Estate Papers comprise 65 pages and are found in folder labeled "Foust, Henry (1840)".
Testator's widow Caroline Rebecca Foust married Daniel C. Hardin of Orange County
Land was divided 15 Mar 1843 into 358 acres, 309 acres and 336 acres with the remainder of the lands being sold.

Robert's full name is Robert Mebane Foust, and William's full name is William Michael Foust.

William (slave) in the inventory is not listed in the division of the estate.  Although there is a boy listed as Billy, this does not seem t oalign well with a man named William.  One space for a girl is left blank.  In the division the name Peggy Jane or Martha might line up with the blank person in the inventory

A receipts dated 1845 shows the Robert Foust paid $32 for "maintenance of Slave Mary & 2 children".  This may mean that Peggy Jane and Fanny are the children of Mary.
