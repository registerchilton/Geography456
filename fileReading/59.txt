Additional Comments:
Loose will only.  Not found in Orange County Will books. This is from Caswell County.

Estate Papers comprise 18 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Moore, Nathan (1829)".  These are detailed and difficult to decipher, but perhaps there is family history here, but it is not obvious.  Additionally it is assumed that further information will be found in Caswell County.
