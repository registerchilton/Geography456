                     of
               James S. Smith

Master of this Court.

Humbly Sheweth to Your Honor Your Orator
James S. Smith of the said County of Orange,
that John Faddis formerly of Hillsboro died
in the year 1829, having previously made and
published his last will and testament in writing
with all proper solemnities, which was duly
proved & recorded soon thereafter. That in & by
said will, that said testator, did devise, &
bequeath, the bulk of his estate, after the death
of his wife, to be equally divided between
his two surviving children Thomas J. Faddis,
and Nancy Womack, then & now, wife
of Jacob P. Womack - with a special provision,
that her part, should be, for her sole and
separate use, free from all control or liability
of her said husband, and that it should be

[page 2]
be[sic] delivered to one Jonathan P. Sneed as her
Trustee, to receive the rent profits & increase
thereof, and apply the same to the use & benefit
of the said Ann or Nancy Womack during
her natural life.  And upon the further Trust
" upon the death of her husband, should she
" survive him, to convey & assign the whole
" moiety both real & personal as well as accumulated
" profits, as well as the increase of the slaves, to
" his said daughter Ann, or in case of her death
" before such conveyance then & in that case it is to
" be ["conveyed to" blot out] conveyed to her children,
" & delivered over to them [???] which more fully appears
by reference to said will.

That Nancy Faddis the widow of the said John,
died in the year 1834 And the aforesaid Jonathan P. Sneed
utterly refused to undertake the Trusteeship devolved in him by said will

That by a decree of This Court made in the
Petition of the said Thoas J. Faddis, Nancy or Ann
Womack, and her husband & children aforesaid, and
the said Nancy Faddis during her life, the real estate
of the said John Faddis decd., in the County of Orange
were directed to be sold, and the sd. Thomas J. Faddis
became the purchaser thereof.  That on the coming
over of the said cause for further directions it
was adjudged & decreed that the share of the purchase
money belonging to the said Nancy Womack and
her children should be lent out by the Clerk &
Master of this Court on interest with good
personal security.  That in pursuance of said
decree the Clerk and Master did lend the monies
belonging to said Womack family, [blot out]
to the sum of Fourteen Hundred & Eighty six

[page 3]
dollars ($1486) to the said Thomas J. Faddis
and your Orator became his surety in the bond given
to the Clerk & Master
to serve[?] the same All which appears of record in said suit, to
which reference is made
            Your Orator further shews, that
in the autumn of 1833, the aforesaid Jonathan P.
Sneed, Thomas J. Faddis, and the aforesaid family
of Womacks, removed together from this state to
Tennessee and ["afterwards settled in" blot out] the
state of Mississippi.  That the said Thomas J. Faddis
returned several times on visits, to Hillsboro, after
their removal, to superintend his own business &
not of the estate of his said Father.
    He further shews that the aforesaid Nancy
Womack, suing as well for the benefit of her children
aforesaid, as for herself, under the Laws of Mississippi
did on the 18th of April 1841, at a place called Oxford
in that state, institute a suit in Chancery
against the aforesaid Thomas J. Faddis, and
Jonathan P. Sneed, the former as Executor, and
the latter as Trustee for her benefit under the
will of the said John Faddis deceased, praying
a general account of all their interest in that
estate of said testator, and specially setting forth,
the sale of the real estate aforesaid, the price at
which it was bought by the said Thomas J. Faddis
and asking that her share of the purchase money should
be decreed to her, and paid over to her.  That
said J. P. Sneed in his answer disclaimed all
interest or liability in the premises, averring his
remuneration under said will which is of record
in the County Court of this County.

[page 4]
The said Thomas J. Faddis answered said Bill
bully, and stated all the facts pertaining to the matters
now in question, as they are herein, before set forth
On the 21st of the said month of April, The cause
came on to be heard, and his Honor the Chancellor
of the State of Mississippi, among other things, was
please to decree as follows Towit " And it further
" appearing to the satisfaction of the Court that Thomas
" J. Faddis was indebted to said complainant
" in the sum of $1486, with interest from the 15th
" of September 1837 amounting to the sum of $1805.
" 50/100 on account of lands sold belonging to
" said estate, and for which the bond of the said
" Thomas J. Faddis with security is now filed in the
" Court of Equity of Orange County, in North Carolina.
" and it appearing also, that the parties in said
" case had argued that the title to the slaves in the
" Bill mentioned should be decreed to the defendant
" Thomas J. Faddis, and that said sum of money
" should be decreed to the Complainant in full satisfaction
" of her rights set up in said Bill.  The Court thought
" fit by & with the advice and consent of the parties
" to order adjudge & decree, that the title to the said
"18 slaves mentioned in the Bill, together with there increase
" be and the same are hereby vested in the said Thomas
" J. Faddis, and that the said Thomas J. Faddis do
" pay to William Webb, who is hereby appointed Trustee
" of said Nancy Womanck, the said sum of $1805. 50/100
" on or before the 1st day of september, otherwise Execution & issue therefor
" as to Law.  [begin underline] And on Payment of said sum the
" said bond filed as aforesaid to be held satisfied. [end underline]

[page 5]
All which will more fully and  at large appear
from inspection of a copy of the record of said
suit in Mississippi, which your Orator has
ready to produce in this Court.
    Your Orator further shews, that he is informed
and believes, that the said William Webb appointed
as Trustee to receive said sum of money for the
said Complainant, refused to undertake the same,
but not William Womack one of the defendants
in this Bill, and one of the children of said Nancy,
or some other person, was by another order of
said court substituted in the place of said Webb -
and he is informed by letters from Mrs Sneed
widow of the said Jonathan P. as well as by
the counsel concerned in conducting said
proceedings in the Court of Chancery of Mississippi
that the said Thomas J. Faddis did pay off,
and satisfy the said decree against him
to said substituted Trustee, the utmost farthing -
And Your Orator has no doubt that such
was the fact.  The said Faddis, was a bachelor
with large fortune, had ample means to
pay that amount on short notice, and as
the proceedings, terminating in said decree were
by consent of parties as appears of record,
Your Orator had no doubt, that the said Faddis had the
money then in hand & paid it, down at
the first amount when he could obtain
a proper voucher.  He therefore charges & intends[?]
to prove that said decree ( which is valid by the
Laws of Mississippi, being rendered by her highest

[page 6]
Court of Chancery) has been paid off & satisfied.
    Your orator is also informed [&] believes that the said
Thomas J. Faddis during the last year died,
and to respresentative[sic] of his estate has qualified
here, nor had he, any estate in North Carolina,
at the time of death, of which your Orator has
any knowledge.  He is also informed & believes
the said Faddis left a last will & testament
devising and bequeathing his estate to the widow
or children of the said Jonathan P. Sneed, who
is also dead, but that a caveat has been
entered to the Probate thereof by the said
Nancy Womack his sister & next of kin. You
Orator is advised that a satisfaction of the decree in
Chancery aforesaid, by said Faddis in his
lifetime is a discharge of the bond in which
he, Your Orator, is surety.  He is also advised
that if the said Nancy Womack shall
succeed in setting aside the will of the said T. J.
Faddis, she will have not rights of action against
him on said bond, because she will then
stand in the stead of his principal, with
a very ample estate to pay ten times
the amount.  And that if said will shall
be established, ["that" x-out] this Court, by its known
rules of Equity & Justice, will not permit
him to be subjected to the payment of the
said bond to the said Nancy Womack or her
children, since they have a decree against
the principal of said bond for the same
demand in Mississippi where his property

[page 7]
is situated, and can readily obtain satisfaction
if they have it not already, by reviving that decree
against the personal respresentative[sic] of the said
Thomas J. Faddis.
            But Your Orator shews that
the said Nancy Womack & her children, for the
fraudulent purpose of compelling him to pay
a second time, what he has no doubt then
have already received from the said T. J. Faddis,
and for his vexation & affliction[?], have made
a requisition on the Clerk & Master of this Court
to which said bond is made payable, to
collect from your Orator the amount of said
bond, or at least the interest thereof. And the
Clerk & Master has accordingly brought a suit
against your Orator, [blot out] bond
which is now pending in Orange County
Court.
            All which actings & doings of the said
Defendants are contrary to Equity & Good Conscience
To the End therefore that all the defendants
first names as aforesaid, may ["upon ???????" smeared ink]
corporal oaths full, true & perfect answers
make to all the allegations herein contained
as fully as if the same had been repeated
by interrogatories. that the said defendants by
name Womack, as well as the said Clerk
& Master James Webb may be forever enjoined
from further prosecuting or maintaining the said
at Law against your Orator as aforesaid. that the
bond aforesaid may be surrendered up to

[page 8]
up to[sic] Your Orator & destroyed that all the aforesaid
defendants may be forever enjoined from vexing
or harrassing[sic] Your Orator in the premises, and that
he may have such other & further relief as his
case may entitle him unto. May it please your
Honor to grant to your Orator Writ of Injunction
restraining all further proceedings against your
Orator in this behalf untill the further pleasure
of this Court shall be known as well as such
other process as may be necessary to compel
the said defendants to appear in this court at
its next term on the 2nd Monday of September
then & there to answer this Bill of Complaint
and to stand to abide by & perform such
order & decree as your Honor shall make
herein. And your Orator as in duty bound &c

    The answer of Thomas Jeff. Faddis, Exr of the
last will & Testament of John Faddis Senr decd
        To
    the Petition of Alexander H. Murphey &
    his wife Eliza. ~~~

   This defendant saving and reserving unto him=
self all manner of benefit & advantage of
exception to the mistakes & insufficiencies of
the Petitioners Petition - for answer there=
unto & to such parts thereof, as he is ad=
vised it is material for him to make
answer unto, answereth & saith - That
he admit that his Father, John Faddis, late
of the Town of Hillsboro, departed this life
in the year 1829, having duly made &
published, in writing his Last Will & Testa=
=ment - in which were nominated as Execu=
tors thereof, Nancy Faddis, Jonathan P. Sneed
and this defendant - that the same was
shortly thereafter admitted to probated
in Orange County Court; and that his
defendant thereupon, alone took upon
himself there burthen of executing the
same, by qualifying as Executor thereof

    This defendant further answer, saith,
that he admits, that the last will & Testament
of his said Testator, does contain a clause

[page 2]
of bequest to Eliza Woman who hath since inter=
=married with the Petitioner Alexander H Mur=
=phey ["such as stated" x-out] such as alledged[sic] in the
petitioners' petition to be an extract But
this defendant is advised and believes and
here alledges, by way of defence among other
things, that the clause of bequeath aforesd
when construe with reference to the other
bequests & divises[sic] in said last will & Testament
contained, and the tenor thereof, and the
obvious will of the Testator as indicated by
the whole instrument taken together -
entitles the petitioners to the possession of the Negro Girl
Mary, mintioned[sic] in said clause, only
upon the happening of the death of Nancy
Faddis, the widow of the said Testator, and the
grandmother of the petitioner Eliza -
as will fully appear, it is believed, by ref=
-erence to the said Will, a copy of
which is hereunto appended - which is
prayer may be take as part of this
answer. This defendant further an=
swering saith, that the said Nancy Faddis
widow & relict of the said Testator is yet
alive - to whom the whole of the Estate
of the said Testator, both real & personal
after first paying the debts due therefrom,
is given in said last Will & Testament during her natural life.-

    This defendant farther answering

[page 3]
saith, that after entering on the execution of
the last Will & testament of his said Testator, he
ascertained, that the Estate of this Testator was
largely indebted - that he hath objected one
or more orders from this Court to sell slave
property of the sd Estate for the purpose of paying
off debts due & owing; that debts still remain
due from sd Estate; and that it is entirely
uncertain, Whether the Whole personal Estate
of his said Testator, which hath come to the
possession of this defendant, will be sufficient
to discharge the amount of debt, now due &
owing from sd Estate. - This defendant farther
answering saith, that it is not true as alleged
in petitioners Petition, that the Petitioner
Alexander H. Murphey had frequently demanded
of this defendant, the negro Girl in question, &
for which sd. petition purpose to have been
filed, - but on the contrary, he alleges that
said Murphey never did demand of him, the
said slave,- and he doth deny the farther
charge in said petition contained, that his
defendant assented to the bequest of the
said slave to the Petitioners, in the manner
and form as therein state. - Wherefore
the defendant prays to be hence
dismissed with his reasonable costs
in ths behalf sustained.
