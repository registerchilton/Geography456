Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume B, pages 204-208
Recorded Aug 1792

"my daughter in law Fanny McKerrall".... is this his bio daughter?  "in Law" at this time could mean many things.

Note 1: James Floyd is listed as "natural son".  While this can mean any biological child, it was often used to indicate an illegitimate son, which seems to be consistent with the surnames not matching.

Note 2: Brigadier General Thomas Person, 1733-1899

Note 3: Fi Fa:  fieri facias, (Latin for "that you cause to be made"), is a writ of execution after a judgment is rendered in a legal action for debt or damages for the sheriff to levy on goods of the debtor.

Note 4:  mesne profits: Mesne (reads as "mean") profits are the damages for trespass. The term means "intermediate profits."

Estate Papers comprise 385 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Child, Francis (1793)". There were several estates being settled in the area for people known as Frances or Francis Child at about the 1790-1830 time period. It appears that all of the estate papers were placed in this folder

One tranche of these papers is dated Aug 1792 - 1811 and executed by Frances Child, widow and executrix of Francis Child, the testator above.  The inventory was taken 27 Aug 1792, but did not include slaves.

thereon; and the Defendant during the time aforesaid

[page 2]
cultivated the said premises, and paid all the rents arising
therefrom to Jesse Benton in his lifetime as agent - of the
said Thomas Hart except a small balance which he
paid to Samuel Benton as Agent of the said Thomas
Hart; and the Defendant saith that he has thus fully paid
and satisfied to the said Thomas Hart who was
seized of the legal estate in the said premises, and
was Trustee to the use of the said Complainant all
rents for the premises while in his possession and
under his cultivation; but can not at this time
particularly set forthe, what ["particularly" x-out], kinds of produce
on what quantities thereof; were so delivered in
discharge of the said rents; nor can this Defendant
at this time, say, in what particular year he so cultivated
the said premises, but that they were the four years
next preceding the sale of the same as the ["as the" x-out]
property of the said Thomas Hart.

        This Defendant saith that he during the term
of four years aforesaid worked only two negro men
with the assistance of three of his Sons, the oldest of them
being then about fifteen or sixteen years of age; and
that he cultivated a greater quantity of ground on
his own plantation than he did on the plantation
so rented.  The Defendant admits that by particular
direction of the said Jesse Benton agent of the said
Thomas Hart as aforesaid he cleared some new land
on the said premises; but denies that he cut any
timber off the said land, more than necessary for
the use of the said plantation.

        The Defendant saith that he was subpoenaed
as a Witness in the first Suit at the insistence of the
Complainant; that his attended ?????? time as a
Witness; that he proved his attendance to the amount

[page 3]
of £26.0.6 or there about; and that he hath warranted
the Complainant and obtained Judgment for the
same; this Defendant admits that , in the Motion
of the Defendants in the said Original suit, it
was ordered by this Court that the amount of
suit attendance should not be ???? in the
Bill of Cost of the said suit against the said
Defendant; And this Defendant insists that,
as it was, at the request, and to the use of the Comp
-lainant he so attended, the complainant was
originally bound to make him satisfaction for
such attendance; and that he is not discharged
for such obligations by the said Order; The
["said" x-out] Complainant since the said Decree
has admitted that this Defendant ought to be
paid for attending as aforesaid.

                          This Defendant save to herself now, and
at all times, all manner of benefit of exceptions to be many uncertain
=ties and insufficiencies in the said Bill contained for answer
thereto, or or to so much thereof as she is advised materially concerns
her to answer, she answereth and saith, that it is true the Com
plainant instituted a suit in this honorable Court against herself
and others, or against others and that she was afterwards
made a Defendant, an therein obtained a decree, and believe the object
of the said suit and tenor of the Decree are correct stated in this
Bill ----

                          The Defendant further saith that so long a
time has elapsed, and his memory is so imperfect that she can
not answer whether Francis her late Husband cultivated
the plantation in question or not, but saith it is possible he did
cultivate it in the year 1792 - She admits she was in possession
of and cultivated the said plantation from the beginning
of the year 1793 to the end of the year 1803: and saith
that she occupied in such cultivation a farm[?] equal to
about three ordinary hands; that she some years made
on the said land a small quantity of Tobacco and wheat,
and in the some years none of either; that she generally made
a tolerable good crop of corn; but as she during that period
believed the said plantation to belong to the estate of her
late husband, she made no entries of the quantities of grain
and other things made therein, and can not now from
memory state them more particularly than she has done
above --- The Defendant denies that she has, within
her recollection, caused any of of the timber on the said land
to be destroyed, or cut for any other purpose, than for the use

[page 2]
and benefit of the said plantation ---

        The Defendant further saith that she is supposed,
believes, and hopes to prove, that the Complainant, before the
year 1792, for a fair and valuable consideration paid to
him by General Thomas Person[See Note 2], late of the County of Greenville,
sold assigned and made over to the said Thomas Person,
all his right, title, and interest in and to the said land
; that the said original suit was commenced and carried on,
or leaving commenced[?] was carried on for the benefit of the
said Thomas ["Thomas" x-out] Person; that the complainant, in
the executrix of his contract with the said Thomas
Person, hath, since the decree aforesaid and the execution
 of the Conveyance made by the Defendant to the
Complainant in obedience thereof, conveyed the legal
title of the said land to the Heirs of he said Thomas
Person or one of them ; and insists that as the Complain
=ant had no beneficial interest in the land at the time
is was in her occupation, he is not entitled [to] to profits
thereof and cannot compel her to account for the
same; and that she aught not to concluded by the
decree aforesaid, because she saith that at the time the
same was made, she had not knowledge of these
facts ---

        The Defendant also insists that as Francis,
her late husband purchased the said land at Sheriffs
sale, without actual notice of the Complainants claim
and paid a valuable consideration for it; that as
she hath taken the profits as well to he use of Samuel
Francis and Wilson Child Orphans of the said Francis
deceased, as to herself; that as the Complainant might

[page 3]
if he is entitled to the profits of the said land, have obtained
a decree for them in the suit aforesaid; she ought not
by his Bill be compelled to account for the said
profits, and thereby be subjected unnecessarily to the costs

be offered for sale at the instance of Hen

plainant Frances Child had no property
only during her life.  I stated to Saml
Child one of the present Defts that if
a Sale took place all she had would
not satisfy the Ex. of Mason and that
he would have his mother to support
That she owed a large Debt to David
Ray & Co for which the Estate was liable
that if the would take up his Mothers
Bond I would loan the money to satisfy
Masons Ex. After consulting with his
Brother as he informed me ["and I believe" x-out], he
agree to do so, and accordingly executed a
Bond with his Brother for both sums, the
Money lent and the amount of his Mothers
Bond. Before the Bond was Executed Mrs.
Child the present Complainant claimed
from Mr Wm Cain a Credit for some
Negro hire for two or three years the

[page 2]
exact sum could not be ascertained But
I promised on the Part of Mr. Cain that as
soon as the account between Mrs. Child &
Mr. Cain was settled that the amount -
should be entered as a Credit on the Bond

    And I do not believe that Samuel Child

                        To the Honorable the Judge of the Court of Equity
               of Orange County

                        Humbly Complaining, sheweth unto your

He bequeathed to your Oratrix during her life the House and Lott
where he then lived, in the Town of Hillsborough, and directed that

[page 2]
he then had on hand to be laid out in the purchase of Young likely
Slaves between twelve and twenty years of age; and those Slaves to be

Executors, one fourth part thereof to the use of his wife, you Oratrix

and the remaining part to be hired out by my Executors for money
to be applied to the use of ["my said wife" x-out] your Oratrix and his
said three Children; and after the death of your Oratrix the seven
slaves and their increase to be equally divided between his said
three Children. -- He thereby further directed that the house he had
moved on Col. McCauley's Lott, in the Town of Hillsborough as it then
stood should be sold to the highest bidder for the term of six years
from the fist day of May 1792, for the same purpose as specific above

--- And thereby nominated and appointed your Oratrix Executrix, and
Robert Freeman and John Casey Executors of the same. And afterward
on the same day, by a Codicil annexed to his said Will, appointed John
Haywood and William Walters Esquires Guardian of his said three
Children: -- You Oratrix further sheweth that the said Testator
departed this life on or about the ____ day of August ___ in

[page 3]
the year 1792 without altering or revoking the said Will and Codicil;
And upon his death, they the said Robert Freeman and John Casey
being requested to prove the said Will, and take upon themselves, jointly
with your Oratrix, the execution of the same, refused to do so, where
upon your Oratrix caused the said Will to be duly proved in the County
Court of Pleas and Quarter Sessions of Orange County and took on herself
the execution thereof; and by virtue thereof possessed herself of all the
personal estate of the Testator and of all the real estate of the Testator
in North Carolina and administered the same, as in and by the Inventory
returned by your Oratrix, and the several accounts hereto annexed, will
more fully and at large appear, to which account your Oratrix
begs leave to refer, and prays they may be taken as part of this her Bill.

    Your Oratrix further sheweth that John Haywood and William
Walters Esquires being request to accept and take on themselves the
Guardianships of the Testators three Children, refused, so to do, or to
intermeddle in any way with their rights or property and no other
person being will to accept of such appointment, the care of the
said Children and their property devolved on your Oratrix; and,
therefore, she ["hath" x-out] continued as Executrix, to manage the said
Children and the estate of Testator until Samuel and Wilson
arrived of full age, and still continue to manage Francis'
part of the said estate Your Oratrix laid out an expended large
sums of money, in the payment of the Taxes of the Western lands,
and in the employment of Agents to procure a Survey of the said
Entry and obtain a grant for the same, and to superintend and
take care of the said lands, as in and by her said account will
more fully appear ---

    Your Oratrix further sheweth that she was the widow
and relict of John McKerall formerly of Norfolk of the State of Virginia
at the time she intermarried with the Testator; that she administered
in the estate of the said John; and by virtue thereof, took into her
possession, and collected, property and money to a very large amount
which she had in her possession at the time she intermarried with
the Testator, and which came to his possessions, and was by him
converted to his own use.  John, Fanny, and William McKerall

[page 4]
the Orphan Children of the said Intestate having not arrived at full
age, at the death of the Testator he had not paid to them their shares
of their Fathers estate: The said John McKerall having arrived of
age, ["and the said Fanny McKerall having intermarried with Abner" x-out]
["B. Bruce" x-out], it was agreed by the parties to refer the settlement of
the estate of the said Intestate John McKerall, to Absalom
Tatom and John Hogg Esquires, and they accordingly settled the
same, and in such Settlement found a balance due to each
of the said Orphans of £514.6.7 3/4; which settlement your Oratrix
believed to be just and fair and therefore paid the said shares---

    Your Oratrix further sheweth that one Henry Mason had
commenced a suit in Equity against Thomas Hart and other for the money
of the Eno land, which suit was depending in the Court of Equity of
Hillsborough District at the time the Testator purchased the same
and such proceedings was afterward therein had that the Complain=
ant, after your Oratrix had expended large sums of money and
time at great trouble in defense of the said lands, recovered ["an" x-out]
Decree for about two hundred acres part thereof, and your Oratrix
was compelled to Convey the same.  And the said Henry Mason
thereupon brought another suit against your Oratrix and Executrix
aforesaid, in the same Court, for the misne[mesne] profits of the land
so reserved; and such proceedings were had in the said suit
that he reserve a decree against your Oratrix for £241.9.
and his costs of suit £41.1.8, and issued[?] out an Execution to collect
the same, and raised it to be levied among other ["things" x-out], slaves
on Hebe and Stephen two of the slaves of the said estate,
and was proposing the sale of the said slaves at public auction,
when your Oratrix, being unable to pay the said monies and
?????? the estate should sustain any loss by that manner
of Sale, sold the said two Slaves to Samuel Child at private sale
in discharge of the amount of the said Decree, and as Executrix
aforesaid Conveyed them to him, and he paid the amount of
the said decree and all costs thereon, and the sheriff returned
the said Execution satisfied - All which will more fully
appear by the records of the said Suits, the decrees made therein;

[page 5]
the Execution and bill of sale aforesaid, and to which your Oratrix
begs leave to refer for greater certainty.  Your Oratrix sheweth that
she did not take possession of the said lands and hold as a separate
property by virtue of the devise to her for life, but managed the same
jointly with and as the rest of the estate of the Testator and aprop
preated the small property initially made therein to the general uses of
of[sic] this estate and family. The profits indeed were small as she
generally kept only one Man Slave, and a woman with three
Children, who she could not hire out on account of the number of
her children, on the said land

    Your Oratrix further sheweth that she in the years 1792
1793 and 1794, as Executrix aforesaid purchased to the uses
mentioned in the said Will seven female and six male
slaves at considerable expense beside the consideration paid
for them.  That as so great a proportion of the slaves of the said
estate were breeding women, she thought it most to the advan-
=tage of the estate that she should undertake to have them properly
taken care of for a reasonable before and after the birth
of their Children, which she has accordingly done with all the attention
in her power, at very great expense and trouble.  And for this
cause, and in manner aforesaid, has been compelled to take
care of, and nurse the said female Slaves, at least a month at
a time forty eight times.  The Children of the said estate, and
the women with so many Children that they would not hire
out, and all the slaves of the estate when sick, being kept
and provided for by your Oratrix, have subjected her to
very heavy charges and expenses; for which she insists that
she is entitled to a liberal allowance --

    Your Oratrix further sheweth that the said Samuel Child
arrived at the age of twenty one years, on the ______ day of _____
in the year ______, and soon afterwards, filed a Petition in
Orange County Court for a division of the Slaves of the said
estate, or part of them, and caused Commissioners for that purpose
to be appointed, who accordingly met and ["agreed" x-out] made some
agreement respecting a division of the said Slaves, but never made
any return to the said Court; nor have the petitioners prosecuted the

[page 6]
said petition since.  The said Samuel and Wilson who was then also
of full age, notwithstanding the said Commissioners did not report
any division to Court; and notwithstanding the said Commissioners did not
pretend to settle the accounts of your Oratrix; took into their possession respectively
sundry of the negroes of the said estate and have held them ever since.

    Your Oratrix further sheweth that the expenses of the said estate,
and the expense of Cloathing, educating, and maintaining
the said Samuel, Wilson and Francis, greatly exceeded the ordinary
profits of the said estate, so as to leave a large balance due
to your Oratrix from her said children, as in and by her accounts
hereto annexed, to which she begs leave to refer, will more fully
appear; and she insists that the young Slaves born and raised
as aforesaid are profits of the said estate, and aught to be
converted by the Court to the discharge of the said balances

    Your Oratrix further sheweth that being indebted to Cain &
Ray Merchants of the Town of Hillsborough in a large amount
a considerable part of which was purchased for the use of the said
Samuel, Wilson and Francis, and of the said estate she executed
to them her bond for the same; which Bond they have since
assigned to the said Samuel Child; and he threatens to sue her
for, and compel her to pay, the whole amount due on the said
Bond, notwithstanding the balance due from him to your Oratrix
on the Account hereto annexed.  Your Oratrix further sheweth the
said Wilson Child departed this life, ["Intestate" x-out] on or about the ____
day of _________ in the year ______ and thus the Administration
of his good and Chattels, rights and credits, with his Will annexed hath been granted to James
Child, by the County Court of Orange; by virtue whereof he has
taken into his possession the personal property of the, Intestate[sic], to a
much greater amount, than is sufficient to pay all his debts

Your Oratrix, conducted the said Executorship, managed the said estate and
the af[f]airs of the said Devises in the best and most advantageous manner
she was capable of; and applied to the said Samuel, and the said Wilson in
his lifetime & his Administrator since his death, to pay or secure to her
the balances due her on her said accounts, and well hoped they would
have complied with so reasonable a request: But now so it is may it

[page 7]
pleas[e] you Honor, that they the said Samuel Child, Francis Child and James
Child Administrator as aforesaid, combining and confederating themselves together
and to and with divers persons unknown to your Oratrix, whose names when
discovered your Oratrix prays may be inserted herein with apt words to be charged
them, contriving now to defraud your Oratrix, and to defeat her of the monies
so due to her, devise that any thing is due from them to your Orator[sic],
and refuse to come to any just settlement with her, In tender consideration
whereof and forasmuch as matter of this nature are most properly cognizable
and releasable[?] in this Court, To the end therefore that the said Samuel
Child, Francis Child and James Child Administrator as aforesaid
may upon their several corporal oaths true and perfect answer make
to all and singular the premises as fully and particularly as if
the same were her again repeated and they therein interrogated.

    And that the said Samuel, Francis and James may be decreed
to come to a just and fair amount with your Oratrix, for the monies
expended in the cloathing, education, and maintaining them the said
Samuel, Wilson and Francis, and expended on behalf of the said
estate, and for monies and other things advanced to them respectively
; that your Oratrix' account as Executrix aforesaid may be finally
settled and adjusted; that the said Samuel and Francis and the
said James as Administrator aforesaid may be decreed to pay to
Your Oratrix the sums justly due from them to her, and that
part of the slaves of the estate may be subjected to the payment
of the same; or that the said Samuel may be decreed to deduct
from the bond aforesaid the amount which may be found
against him on taking the said Account, and if he should attempt
to sue on the said Bond that he may be injoined[sic] until the said
amount shall be taken: that the sale aforesaid of the two slaves
Hebe and Stephen may be confirmed by the decree of this Court
that all further proceedings on the Petition filed in the County
Court of Orange may be injoined; And that your Oratrix may
have all such further and other relief as to your Honor
may seem just and right: May it pleas[e] your Honor to grant
Writs of Subpoena to be served on Samuel Child of Hillsborough
in Orange County, and on Francis Child of the same place; and on
James Child, Administrator aforesaid, of the same place to

                  To the Honorable the Judge of Court of
                  Equity of Orange County
                  The Answer of Samuel Child to the Bill
                  of Complaint of Frances Child

    This Defendant saving & reserving to himself the benefits
of all manner of exception to the numerous errors mistakes &
uncertainties, in Complainant's Bill of Complaint contained
for answer thereunto, or to so much thereof as he is advised it is
material & necessary for him to answer unto - Answering saith -
That he admits his father Francis Child departed this life in
the year 1798 - having duly made & published his last will and
testament - That the Complainant Frances Child is the widow
of said Testator & that she together with John Casey & Robert
Freeman, were appointed Executors of the aforesaid last will &
testament -- that the said John Casey & Robert Freeman declined
interfering with the management of said estate, & that the said
Frances qualified as Executrix of said Testator, & took upon her the
burthen of executing said Testators will -- that John Haywood
& William Watters, who were by said will appointed guardians
of this defendant & his brothers declined accepting said guar=
dianship & that his property together with that of his brothers
Wilson & Frances, has since the death of their said father, contin=
ued to the present time in the hands of Complainant - but he
denies that she was ever legally constituted his guardian - but has
continued to manage his estate without any due authority --

This Defendant admits that the devised contained in Testators
said Will are substantially set forth in Complainant's Bill
of Complaint. -- The Complainant charges that she has paid
large sums of money for the taxes of the West Land, & in the

[page 2]
"employment of Agents to procure a survey of said ["Land" x-out] entry &
"retain a grant for the same, & to superintend & take care of the
"said Land" -- This Defendant knows not, nor does he admit that
any large sums of money have been paid, nor that agents have
been employed by Complainant to have the said entry surveyed
& a grant obtained for the same - or for taking care of said Land -
nor does he think that if such to be the case, he is compellable either
by the rules of Law or Equity to pay any such agent. -- This
Defendant admits that, before she intermarried with his fa=
ther, this Complaint was the widow of John McKerrall - but
he does not admit, because he does not know such to be the case, that she
administered upon his estate, & took unto her possession & collected
property & money to large amount - nor does he admit that such
property & money if so collected, every came into the possession of
his said father, & by him converted to his own use - This Defendant
is therefore compelled to demand from Complainant strict proof
of such facts - This Defendant admits that he has been informed
that the settlement of the estate of John McKerrall was referred
to John Hogg & Absolom Tatom, but whether they ever made up
an award, or what was the substance of said award, if ever made
which is not admitted, he does not know, & therefore does not admit
& consequently denies - & called upon the Complainant to prove the
same - This however he does know, that the children of the said
John McKerrall (to wit) John & William McKerrall & Fanny
McKerrall now Fanny Bruce, were supported & educated by his
father from the time of his intermarriage with their mother
the Complainant, until his death - at least he has been so inform
=ed & believes it to be the case - & after the death of his said fa=
ther the said John McKerrall & Fanny Bruce, continue to live
with the Complainant, & to be supported out of the common stock --

This Defendant admits that the decree of the Court of Equity of

[page 3]
Hillsboro' district in favor of Henry Mason, against Thomas Hart
& other is correctly set forth in Complainant's Bill of Complaint

With respect to the judgment for the mesne [See Note 4] profits, the Defendant
would beg leave to submit the following statement - by the Will of
The Testator as set forth by Complainant The Testator devised to her
during her life the Land above-discribed[sic], being the same which
Testator purchased at public sale, formerly the property of Thomas
Hart - & after her death to be sold for money for the use of his said
three sons -- That the Complainant took possession & so remained in
possession, enjoying the rents & profits until the decree in Equity
& until her sale to James Clark hereinafter mentioned, which was
more than three years from the time of her taking possession of
said Land - This Defendant therefor denies that she is entitled
to be remunerated out of his property or that of his brothers the said
sum of £282:10.8. set forth in her Bill - He denies that Com=
plainant was sued as Executrix for the mesnne profits of said Land
but that she was sued in her individual capacity - this Defendant
admits that he paid the execution which issues on said judgment
& for satisfaction took from Complainant a Bill of sale for the
negroes Hebe & Stephen, which conveyance if necessary he prays
may be confirmed to him - Whether the Complainant took pos=
session of said Land under the devise to her to hold as separate
property, or whether she took possession of it as guardian of this
Defendant, & his brothers he really cannot tell - he never heard
of any disclaimer of the devise until the filing of Complainant's
Bill - this however he does know - that the Land was by the
Will devised to her during her life, & after her death to be sold
& equally divided between this Defendant & his brothers Wilson &
Francis - that the said Land was sold to James Clark by Complain
=ant, - that this Defendant joined in the conveyance to Clark
but upon the express condition that Clark should pay to him

[page 4]
his third of the purchase money, which was accordingly done
the said James Clark transferring to him notes for £60 which
he received as satisfaction of this third part - with what proprie=
ty therefore, Complainant in her Bill charges with using
the Land as joint stock, & in the account against this Defen=
dant annexed to said Bill, & which she prays may be taken as
part thereof, charges this Defendant with £60 in a note recd. of
Clark for sale of Eno land, it being as before stated his thrid part of
the purchase money given by said Clark for said land, & to which
under the will of his father he was entitled, -- he cannot pretend
to say --- Let her have taken the land however in either capacity
he cannot think the Complainant any way entitled to receive back
from this Defendant the said £60 or any portion thereof --

This Defendant admits that the Complainant purchased
during the years '92 '3 '4 seven female and six male slaves - that
the female[s] have had a number of children, how many he does
not know - & he is willing on his part that Complainant should
receive a reasonable allowance for nursing said women during
their confinements - The Defendant admits that upon his coming
of age in the year 1807 or soon after - he filed his petition in Orange
County Court for a division of the personal property of his father's
estate, that Commissioners were appointed by the Court for that
purpose who divided off to this Defendant a certain number of
slaves which he took into his possession with the knowledge &
with the consent of the Complainant -- that the said Commission
=ers never completed this division, but that the suit is still
depending in said Court. --- This Defendant denies that
the profit of said estate were not equal to the maintaining
of himself & brothers - but if they were not, that it was owing
entirely to mismanagement - The Complainant pray your
 Honor to grant her a writ of injunction to enjoin this Defendant
                                                     from suing

[page 5]
from suing her upon a bond of hers which he hold in his
hands upon the ground that he is indebted to her - this Def-
endant presumes that before your Honor issues an injunction
against a demand admitted to be just - the Complainant will
be required to shew that this Defendant is indebted to her
indebted that she cannot avail herself of it in a trial at Law.

This Defendant begs leave to state to you Honor, that no Inventory
of the goods & Chattels of his said father, the late Francis Child
decd. has been returned & file by the Complainant, nor has she
returned any account of the sales of the personal estate as by
law she is required & directed to do -- In consequence of which
said omissions on her part, this Defendant is precluded from
the use of vouchers wisely intended by the law, for the protection
of orphans' estates -- He however has been informed. & believe, &
hopes to be able to prove, to the satisfaction of this Honorable
Court that a large portion of the estate of his said father
was never sold by Complainant, but was converted to her own use.

In the account annexed to Complainant's Bill of Complaint, then
is no mention made of any cattle, horse, hogs or plantation tools, which
were directed by Testator to be sold at twelve months credit, for the
use of this Defendant & his brothers Wilson & Francis - The Testator
also directed that the plantation he purchased of Robert Faucett
should be sold at the like credit & for the same purpose - This plan
=tation was not sold by Complainant until 8 or 9 years after Testa
=tor's death - the rents of said plantation during those years is nowhere accounted for,
he presumes to hope that he is entitled to his third of said rents
whatever they may be -- The Testator left at his death four
horses which this Defendant well recollects - how many more he
does not know - he left also some cattle & a stock of hogs, & plan=
=tation tools -- these are nowhere accounted for. -- By the 10th
Item, the Testator devised that the house, he had lately moved on
Colo. McCauley's lot, should be sold as it then stood for the term of
six years, the money for the use of this Defendant & his two

[page 6]
brothers - if this lease was every sold, as he presumes it was, there
is not account of it anywhere rendered - With respect to Com=
plainant's account against his father's estate, annexed to her Bill
this Dependent will make but a few remarks - also on the
credits she has given -- With respect to the latter the Defendant
would remark - That in Testator's Will as set forth in Com=
plainant's Bill, there is a bond upon James Caswill for £170 of
which no notice is taken, Alexander Mebane's note for £117. Robert
Freeman's note for £33 Virginia money equal to £55 current, &
Mumford Stokes' note for £35. -- in her account she has taken
no notice of any interest which may have accrued upon these notes,
but given credit for the principal only -- & as to Stokes' note she credits
only £15.7.6 --- In Complainant's account against the estate she credits herself with
large sums of money paid to the Heirs of Jno. McKerrall - this
Defendant knows not by what right those sums were paid & there
=fore calls upon Complainant to prove there payment, & the reason
why -- One item of her account is £100 as specified in the will -
By his will Testator directed that £100 should be ["paid" x-out] retained
by his widow for the use of herself & his children - this Defendant there
=fore thinks himself justly entitled to one fourth part of said
£100 -- two other Items in said account are as follows, "paid
"McKerrall for going to Tennessee concerning Western Lands £150"
"ditto for going to Kingston suspecting Caswell's bond £30" making
in the whole £1800 or $361 which the agency netted Mr. McKerrall.

This Defendant submits to this honorable Court, whether the
complainant is by Law entitled to run the estate of this Defen=
-dant & his brothers, to any expense she might thin proper, or
at any rate to so enormous a charge, more especially when it
shall appear that said McKerrall did not as state in Complain
=ants Bill, survey the Western Land covered by his father's entry
nor procure a grant for the same both of which remains yet
to do ---

[page 7]
The Complainant has filed a long account against thie Def-
endant in his individual capacity - of the items of which this
Defendant has no personal knowledge, with a very few exep=
tions - he therefore calls upon complainant to prove them as he
denies them -- With respect to the item of £60 this Defendant
has already remarked, it was his third part of the purchase
money of the Eno Land devised to him & his brothers after the death
of Complainant, which land was sold by complainant to James
Clark, & the £60 paid over to Defendant by notes by said Clark
by direction, or with the knowledge & permission of  Complainant -
with respect to the last Item £35 paid for Defendant's expenses
to Tennessee - this Defendant went as the agent of Complainant
& of course is not liable to refund any portion of said £35. or if any
not more than one third part thereof - As to the account filed by
Complainant against the Heirs of Francis Child, of whom hit
Defendant is one, it will appear by examing[sic] said account to be incor=
rect & incomplete - not accounting fairly & justly for the hire of
the negroes, many of them being omitted in different years --

This Defendant begs leave further to shew to your Honor, that
the 9th Item of his said father's will is in these words following
"I will & bequeath the seven following slaves (to wit) Jack, Maria
" & child, Hannah, Sylvia, Grace, & Alleck, to be disposed of as follows
"Hannah & Sylvia to be kept for the serve of my wife during her
"natural life, & the remaining five to be hired out, by my Executor
"for many, which is to be applied to the use of my said wife &
"three children, & after the death of my said wife then the said
"seven negroes & there increase to be equally divided between my
"said children" --- Under this devise this Defendant conceives
himself entitled to one fourth part of the hire of the five negroes
directed to be hired out by the above clause, together with
one fourth part of the hire of the increase of those negroes
This defendant has been of age now upwards of five years, &
has, during that period, not receive one cent for his share of

[page 8]

the hire of said negroes --- This Defendant is anxious that
the business of the estate should be brought to a final close, firmly
believe that from the voucher furnished by complainant her=
self, he shall be able to shew this Honorable Court, that so
far from being indebted to her, she is largely indebted to him.

    This Defendant denying all combination prays hence to
be dismissed with his costs, in this case most unjustly sustained

The Defendant Saml. Child maketh oath, that the several
mattes of fact contained in the answer, & state as of his own
knowledge are true, & those state as mot of his own knowledge
he believes to be true
