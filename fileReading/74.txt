tion thereof by the said James Johnson is proved

Johnson and the same is ordered to be recorded

                             Test

[Note: the wording of this is unusual, wordy and awkward.  It appears that this will was not recorded, so perhaps this was written by a new clerk or one not accustomed to dealing with probate?]

Additional Comments:
Although "Executor qualified" is written at the bottom of the will, did not find a version of this in the will books.
