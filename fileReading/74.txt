Difficult to read due to poor handwriting, non-standard spellings, many skipped words.  Appears to use a combination of phonetic spelling and strong dialect.  Many instances of "a" used in place of "o".  Transcribed here as "Jonathan", always written as "Janathan".  The word "bequeath" appears with a wide variety of spellings, and does the word "heirs".
