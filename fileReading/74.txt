Many instances of non-standard spelling and extra commas. Intent is clear, so spelling and punctuation was kept as in the original.

Estate Papers comprise 32 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Miller, James (1821)".  It appears that was a miller.  There is an account of the sales of hundreds of bushels of wheat to numerous people.  Inventory taken 20 Dec 1820 includes four unnamed negroes.  Only one named in the will, and she is probably among these four, because three other slaves were later sold at the estate sale.  On 1 Mar 1823, nearly two years after the sale, the executors sued to recover $645.77, principal, interest and damages. He appealed, lost and had to pay additional court costs and interest.
