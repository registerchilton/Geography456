Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume D, pages 560-561

It appears that the scribe for this will assumed that the testator could not sign his own name, and put in the signature to be acknowledged with a mark.  This was crossed out and the testator signed.

Estate Papers comprise 17 pages and are found in folder labeled "Forsyth, William (1819)".  Inventory consists of one page and appears incomplete.  No slaves listed as sold at estate sale, but there was a separate note, listed below.

"Arter" could be Arthur, or Artes
