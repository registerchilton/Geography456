Estate Papers comprise 14 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Clendenin, William (1846)".  This appears to be a mix of this testator's accounts with executor of John Stockard.

These papers might pertain to more than one testator. Heirs are listed as Catharine Clendenin, Mary Clendenin, Nancy Clendenin, Benjamin Clendenin and Rebecca Clendenin.  These names are not in this will, and are part of a petition of 1838, so it is unlikely that these petition belongs to this testator's estate.
