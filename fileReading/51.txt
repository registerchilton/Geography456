ters of Josiah Turner I give and bequeath

in full they shall be paid two years after my death
& any deficiency made up by the interest on the mo-
ney due to me & ["such" x-out] the hires of such of the negroes

Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume F, pages 249-253
Recorded May 1845

Note 1: "Ann" in Will, "Anna" in estate papers

Note 2: In the will, Margaret has two children, Ann and Albert.  Here she appears to have three, with one perhaps so young it is not yet named?

Note 3: cestique - a short version of cestui a que use le feoffment fuit fait, which is the person for whose use the feoffment was made, in modern terms a beneficiary. It is a French legal  phrase of medieval English invention, which appears in the legal phrases cestui que trust.

Note 4: remainderman - is a property law term that refers to the person who inherits or is entitled to inherit property upon the termination of the life estate of the former owner.

Note 5: Writ of Detinue - detinue is an action to recover personal property that was wrongfully taken.

Estate Papers comprise 100 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Estes, Eliza (1845)".  The legatees for whom Josiah Turner held property in trust did not feel he acted correctly, so much of these papers concern complaints, depositions, summonses, etc. pertaining to the disputes.  Some papers are even dated to 1871 when Josiah had been declared non-compos mentis and another trustee was appointed in his stead, obviously no longer dealing with the negroes that were willed, but there was considerable property.

Per the estate papers she died "sometime in 1845"
Isabella Bridges is referred as Isabella M. Irby, married Hordyman Irby after the death of Young Bridges in the 1850's.

Several of the estate papers referring to negros or slaves are challenging to decipher and are not listed here.

Mariah Dodd was the wife of James Dodd

[page 4]
that he has been greatly troubled
by reason of the Trust imposed
upon him by the will of Mrs Eliza
Estes - Mrs Isabella Irby who has
only a life estate - having on
two occasions sold without
consulting ["the Trustee" x-out] Your
Petitioner the Trustee - and in
as much as the cestique
trusts desire it and your petitioner
the Trustee is fore advan

able to execute the Trust as
he should do owing to
his advanced age and
the distance between himself
and the cestique Trustees - He
therefore askes Your Honor

It is desired by Mrs Irby ["that" x-out]
and her husband the next friend
of the remainderman [Note 4] that
the new Trustee shall buy
a servant and put in
the place of Romana with
the 950 dollars for which Roma[na]

The bill of compliant of Josiah Turner
                 Against
            James Dodd

    Humbly complaining sheweth unto your
Honor Your Orator Josiah Turner of the
County of Orange - that Eliza Estes of Orange
County died in the year 1845 having first
duly made & published a last will and
testament properly executed to pass her
personal estate which after her death
was duly proved in Orange County Court
and now remains there of record; and
that the said will among other thing
contained the following clause
"I give and bequeath to my niece Maria
Dodd negroes Sam Mary Ann Mitchel
and Fred " -- In a codicil to said
will is the following clause -
"I revoke whatsoever I have given
to Mrs Dodd and give and bequeath
the negroes which were given to her to
Josiah Turner for her sole and separate
use free from the controls of her husb
-and and of any liability for his debts;
and at her death equally to be divided
among her children

[page 2]
Your Orator Shews that Mrs Dodd is
the wife of James Dodd of Fayetteville and
having confidence in said Dodd, and thinking
the interest of Mrs Dodd and her children
would be promoted - suffered said
Dodd to remove the said negroes to his
house in the Town of Fayetteville where they
wee employed - part of them as house
servants for Mrs Dodd and part of them
hired out - Your Orator is informed
and believ[e]s that said Dodd sold one
of the slave to t trader without the knowle
dge or consent of your Orator - And did
sell the woman Mary Ann and the
purchasers learning his title was not good
returned her again to said Dodd -
   Your Orator has cause a writ in
Detinue[Note 5] to be issued against said James
Dodd - to dispossess him of said slaves
Mitchel - Mary Ann, and her two children
Said writ returnable - to the Superior Court
for the County of Orange in 1851 - Your Orator
fears and believ[e]s, that, before Said suit
at Law can be heard and determined
said James Dodd will sell the ballance[sic]
of said slaves - and they be carried beyond
the jurisdiction of this Court - and the
said Dodd is reputed to be insolvent
and has executed a deed of trust to
secure his debts -
    All which actings and doings on the
part of said Dodd are contrary to Equity
and good conscience and tend to the
manifest injury and wrong of Your Orator

[page 3]
   And for as much as Your Orator is without remedy
save in this Honorable Court, when matters of this kind
are cognizable, To the end therefore that the said
James Dodd may be compelled & enjoined to
desist from all further attempts, to sell any
other of said slaves now in this possession
and that such other and further relief
may be grated unto Your Orator, as he is
entitled to; May it please your Honor to grate
unto Your Orator - the writ of Injunction
and Sequestration - enjoining the
said defendant from selling any
other of said slaves and requiring
him in such sum[?] by sequestration as
Your Honor may think proper to have
the said slaves Mitchel Mary Ann
and her two children forth coming when
the suit in detinue shall be determined
And also the writ of subpeona command
-ing him to appear at the next Term
of Orange Court of Equity - then and
there upon his corporal oath to answer
the allegations contained in this bill in the
same manner according to his knowledge and
belief in every respect; in the same
manner as if the same were here
repeated by many interrogatories, and
then and there stand, to perform the decree
which may be made in the premises

The Answer of Thos S. Lutterloh Trustee etc
to the Bill of Complaint of Josiah Turner Senr.
filed in Orange County Court of Equity
    This defendant saving and reserving all and
all manner of exceptions etc. to the said Bill for
answer therewith saith. That he was appointed
Trustee by the Court of Equity of Cumberland County
in the room and stead of Josiah Tuner Senr. and
gave bond according to the decree That Josiah
Turner after great deliberation conveyed the slaves
and a Lot of Land to this defendant as Trustee
of Maria Dodd, after he was server with notice from[?]
said Court that if he did not do so he would be in[?]
contempt -
   That he holds the said property of said Maria under
the same uses and trusts as are contained in the
Will of Eliza Estes -
That - the property in his hand is applicable to the sole
and seperate[sic] use of Maria Dodd, and not for the
purpose of paying costs incurred by the negligence
or mismanagement of any former Trustee - As to
the suits and bills of costs mentioned in the Bill
this defendant knows nothing, but contends that
if the Complainant has brought suits, it has been
because he did not husband the property as he
ought to have done - That the permitting an insol-
vent man Jas. Dodd to keep possession of the
said slaves, was of itself an act done upon his
own personal responsibility, and if any loss
has , or might have accrued , the fund in the hand
of this defendant is in no way responsible

    Cumberland County }    In Equity
    To the Honorable The Judge of the Court aforesaid
        The Petition of James Dodd and wife Maria -
    Humbly complaining shew unto your Honor - That some time
since one Eliza Estes of Orange County in said state died , having pre-
viously published her last will and testament sufficient in to convey
personal estate: and which said last will and testament, was duly ad-
mitted to record in the Court of Pleas and Quarter Sessions for Orange County
and not remains there of record - That amongst other bequests in said
will and testament is the following, to wit, "I give and bequeath to
my Niece Mariah Dodd, negroes Sam, Mary Ann, Mitchel and Fred"
and in a codicil to the same, is the following, to wit "I revoke whatsoever
I have given to Mrs Dodd, and give and bequeath the negroes which
were given to her to Josiah Turner for her sole and seperate[sic] use free from
the control of her husband and of any liability for his debts, and at her
death equally to be divided among her children-["] Your Petitioners fur-
there shew that the said Josiah Turner Trustee as aforesaid is a resident
of the said County of Orange, and that your Petitioners are residents of the
County of Cumberland - That some time since the said Josiah Turner
Trustee as aforesaid placed in the possession of your Petitioner the said
negroes where they have remained ever since with the exception of one at-
tending on the family of your Petitioners and contributing to their
support - Your Petitioners further shew to your Honor that an action
of Detinue has be instituted against James Dodd one of your Petition-
ers by the said Josiah Turner to recover the possession of said negroes, &
also a write of Sequestration has been served on him returnable to Spring
Term 1850 of Orange Superior Court the said Josiah alleging that your
Petitioner James Dodd has sold one of the negroes to wit Fred, and that
he the said Josiah was fearful that your Petitioner James Dodd would
sell he balance of the negroes belonging to the trust.  Your Petitioners
admit that the negro Fred was sold, for the reason that he had become
almost unmanageable and of bad and intemperate habits and was
likely to prove almost valueless: that several men of prudence and
respectability had advised that the said slave Fred should be disposed
of: and that a day or two before he was sold, information in an authentic
shape came to your petitioners and verily believed by them that the
said Fred was about to abscond to some free state - and that your Pe-
titioners fearful that he might elope before the said Josiah Turner
could be consulted, sold him for an excellent price, and for his
full value in cash, That the purchase money has been loaded
out to good and responsible men and ready to be produced when-
ever this Honorable Court may direct and decree - that nothing
but the emergency of the case, the earnest request of his wife

[page 2]
and the advice of prudent and discreet men induced him to sell
the said slave Fred without the advice or permission of the said Josiah
Turner: that all he has done, has been done in good faith and for the
benefit of his wife and children, whose interest he had consulted and
advanced by the course pursued by him, for it is verily believed
that the said Fred would doubtless have made his way to some free State
where probably he would have been lost wholly and entirely - Your
Petitioners further shew that they are desirous of changing the Trustee
under said Will and Testament, to wit, the said Josiah Turner and
substituting some other good and discreet person in is place and
stead, and for reason whereof say, That the said Josiah is about to
resume possession of the said negroes and remove the same to Hillsboro
in said County of Orange, where you Petitioners allege that they will not
hire out for near as much as they would in Fayetteville, as for instance
one of the said slaves was hired out in the former place for forty Dollars
whereas he was hired for one Hundred Dollars per annum in Fayetteville
Further that your petitioners are desirous of removing from Fayetteville
to some place where the interest of their children will be promoted and
are anxious to take the said slaves with them without whom they cannot
well remove - That the brother of Mrs Dodd will accept of the appoint-
ment, a gentleman of character and standing who will give such bond
as the Court may direct, and who is also desirous of removing with his
sister - Your Petitioners further say that there is no good understanding
between your Petitioners and the said Josiah Turner having had
and now have law suits between them and on that account are
anxious to have him the said Josiah removed, and it is unpleasant
to have dealings and settlements with him - For these causes & others
which you your Honor will be exhibited, if necessary - Your Petitioners
pray that a copy of this petition may be served on said Josiah Turner
together with the State's writ of Subpoena commanding him to be
and appear at the next Term of the Court of Equity to be held for Cumberland
County on the 7th Monday after the 4th Monday of September 1850 then
and there to show cause why he should not be removed as Trustee
and some other substituted in his place
             And your Petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray

                                    March Term 1852

        To the Honorable the Judge of the Court
of Equity for said County - The Bill of Complaint of
                  Josiah Turner Sr
                      Against
   James Dodd and Wife ["Eliza" x-out] Maria and Thomas
S Lutterloh Trustee
                         Humbly complaining sheweth unto
your Honor. Your Orator Josiah Turner Sr. - that
Eliza Estes of Orange County died in the year 1845 -
having first duly made and published ["her" x-out] a
last will and testament sufficient in law to
pass personal estate, which after her death was
duly proven in Orang[e] County Court and now
remains there of record; And that the said
will among other things contained the following
clause. to wit: I give and bequeath to my niece
Mariah Dodd negroes Sam Mary Ann, Mitchel and
Fred - And in a codicil to the same is the following
: to wit: " I revoke whatsoever I have given to Mrs Dodd
and give and bequeath the negroes which were given
to her to Josiah Turner for her sole & separate
use free form the control of her husband

[page 2]
and of any liability for his debts and at her
death equally to be divided among her children
Your Orator further sheweth that after he took upon
himself the execution of the Trust he suffered The
Said Slaves to be take to the Town of Fayetteville
where Mrs Dodd resid[e]s where they remained for
four or five years.  Information reached your
Orator sometime in the year 1850 that one of the slaves
by the name of Fred had been sold, by Dodd & wife
to one Johnston a negro trader residing in the state
of L[o]uisiana.  and that the said Dodd was offering
to sell other negroes belonging to the Trust - Your Orator
sent an agent in pursuit[?] of said Johnston who
returned without finding him; but returning to the
State again - a Writ in detinue was served upon
him, returnable to Orang[e] Superior Court.  The Cost
of which Your Orator has paid amounting in all
with attornies[sic] fees to twenty six dollars & thirty cts
   Your Orator still desiring Mrs Dodd to have the
full benefit of the trust - by keeping the slaves
about her house, sent an agent to Fayetteville
to demand security, that, the Said Dodd would
sell no more of the said slaves; This reasonable
demand on the part of your Orator he[?] refused
to comply with - whereupon Your Orator
caused a writ in detinue to be issued against
said Dodd to recover possession of said slaves
and at the same time a Bill of injunction and

[page 3]
Sequestration to prevent the further sale or
removal of the slaves from the state -
    Pending these suits Dodd and wife
filed a Bill in Cumberland Court of Equity
for the appoint of a Trustee i lieu of
Your Orator - alledging[sic] that Your Orator intended
to take the slaves back to Orange County where they
would hire for about half as much as they
would in Fayetteville that these were suits
instituted by your Orator again him, etc. No breach or
mismanagement of the trust was alledged against Your
Orator as will be seen by the Bill a copy of
which is herewith submitted to Your Honor as part of
This Bill - Your Orator cause an answer to be
filed ["the" x-out] to the Bill of Dodd & wife for which he paid
twenty dollars - A decree was made in
Cumberland Court - removing Your Orator
and appoint Thomas S. Lutterloh Trustee
in his stead, who entered into bond for the
faithful execution of the Trust - Cumberland
Court comeing before the Court of Orange
Your Orator was removed before the final hearing
of the causes in Orange Court - You Orator
obtained a judgment against said Dodd
in Orange Court at the last Fall Term for the said
negroes- and a decree for his cost in the
Bill which was filed - The Court before - The Clerk
and Master issued Execution against said
[page 4]
[not stated] for his costs: The Sheriff of Cumberland returned
upon said Execution nothing to be found ; the said
Dodd then served notice on the Clerk and Master that
he intended to take the benefit of the insolvent
debtors law - which he accordingly did - and your
Orator has paid to the said Clerk and Master the said
Bill of Cost amount to thirty one dollars and
sixty five cts. and also the further sum of thirty
dollars and ninety cts. the cost and expenses in the
suit at law against said Dodd- for the slaves in
which suit Your Orator obtained a judgement[sic] but
owing to the insolvency of said Dodd Your Orator
had the cost to pay all of which sums and costs
Your Orator has incurred to protect the estate in remainder
to Mrs Doods[sic] children and which he submits in Equity
and good conscience the Trustee Thomas S Lutterloh
should repay to him: And your Orator has
called upon said Trustee repeatedly so to do: but not
withstanding The justice of Your Orators clain - and
the ability of the Trustee to pay it - (he having the control
of the said slaves) has refused and still refuses
so to do - all of which actings and doing[s] and refusals
on the part of Said Lutterloh confederating in the said
Dodd and wife tend to tend to the manifest injury of
Your Orator, And for as much as he is without
remedy save in this Honorable Court, To the end
therefore that he said Dodd & wife - and the said Thomas
Luttlerloh may be compelled upon their corporal oaths
full true and perfect answer make, to the premises
the same as if it were again repeated and the
thereunto inter[r]ogated: and in particular that the
Said Dodd and wife answer - - whether they did
not sell the Boy Fred - and whether Mrs Dodd

[page 5]
did-not urge upon her husband to sell
one of the girls May Ann, and whether he did-
not offer, or threaten to do so - And whether Your
Orator did-not call upon said Dodd through
an agent to give security that he would
not sell any more of the said slaves , and if
he did not refuse to give the security; before
any Bill was filed or writ issued against
him for Said Slaves - And in particular that
the said Lutterloh answer whether he was not appoin-
-ted trustee by the Court of Equity of Cumberland
and if he has not given bond and taken upon
himself the duties of executing the Trust - and
if he has not been called upon by letter and other
-wise to settle the said costs and charges - And
Your Orator prays that an account may be taken
by one under the direction of This Honorable Court
of what is due and oweing to Your Orator - That
the defendant Lutterloh may be decreed to pay
unto your Orator what may be justly due and
oweing: And that Your Orator may have such other &
further relief in the premises as his case may
require and to your Honor may deem meet. - May it
pleas[e] Your Honor to grant unto your
Orator the states writ of Subpoena to be
directed to the said defendants
Dodd & wife and Thomas Lutterloh

[page 6]
thereby commanding them to appear
at our next Superior Court of Equity to be
held for the county of Orange at the Court House
in Hillsboro on the 2d Monday in March next -
then and there to answer to stand to perform
and abide such further order and decree
as may be made in the premises.
and as in duty bound your Orator ever

[Estate Papers - Answer to Bill of Complaint]
State of North Carolina -    In Equity

The Answer of James Dodd and Wife Maria
to the Bill of Complaint of Josiah Turner Senr.
filed in Orange Court of Equity --
    There defendants reserving to themselves all
right of exception to the said Bill of Complaint,
for answer thereto says &c They admit that Eliza
Estate of Orange County died as stated in the Bill:-
that she left a will which was duly proven and
in which is contained the clause that codicil
as stated in the Bill - That it is true the Complain-
ant suffered the slaves mentioned in the will
(with the exception of Sam which the Complainant
never has delivered to these defendants and for
which he has never accounted) to remain with
the defendant James Dodd:- That the boy Fred be-
came unruly and dangerous, and was in all
probability making preparations to abscond, and
the defendants living a great distance from the
Trustee the defendant James Dodd thought it prudent and proper to dispose
of said slave, which he accordingly did
at a fair and full price, and in order to
carry out the intentions of the testatrix by advan-
cing the interests of the co-defendant Maria, he
invested the amount received for said slave
in a Lot and dwelling House in the Town of
Fayetteville, and caused the title to be made
to "Josiah Turner Trustee of Maria Dodd"-
That some time after said sale was made and
the purchase of the lot effected one Josiah Tuner
Jr appeared as the agent of the Complainant
and the defendant James Dodd told the said
agent what he had done, and the said agent

[page 2]
expressed himself fully satisfied at what had
been done - That the said agent to be certain that
the story was true went to the vendors of the Said Lot
to wit Sampson Boon and Hester McMillan; and was
satisfied that the deed was made as represented ~~
These defendants further state That all this infor-
mation and all these acts were well Known by the
Complainant long before he instituted the suits at
Law against James Dodd and S Johnson and be-
fore the Injunctions issued from the Court of Equity of
Orange County - These defendants claiming[?] that any
copy of any Bill in Equity from Orange County was
served upon them and they had no opportunity of
filing an answer and ought not in any event
be liable for these costs, Fini: an Injunction was
served and bond was given acceptable to the sheriff
of Cumberland but these defendants has no means
to answer any Bill that may have been filed against
then if any never having accepted a copy  These defendants expressly deny that
they or either of them at any time either before the
commencement of the said suits or since ever offered
for sale or intended to offer for sale, any of the Slaves
devised as aforesaid, with the exception of Fred - and
he was sold at the request of a large number of the
citizens of Fayetteville - That these defendants through
their counsel John Winslow Esquire, before the suits
were instituted, did proffer to give ample security for
the forthcoming of the slaves, and he was told by the
agent Josiah Turner Jr that ["it was unnecessary" x-out] he would not take security
these defendants say That the incurring of these costs
was wholly unnecessary and useless and that they
were instituted for the sole purpose of harassing them
and benefiting himself and that believing this they
filed their Bill in Cumberland Court of Equity to

[page 3]
remove the Complainant as Trustee, and at the
return term he filed his answer and the Court upon
Bill and Answer removed him from his said trustee-
ship and substituted in his stead Thomas S Lutterloh
of Cumberland -
   These defendants continue that the costs of these suits
were unnecessarily and improvidently incurred : that
the Complainant was well aware of all the fact and
circumstances, and ought to have been well satisfied
say further That there is no reason in Equity why these
costs should come from the fund of Maria Dodd in
any event as the liability as Trustee cannot be shifted
from an irresponsible person upon the trust fund.
    That if the Trust fund should be subjected to the payment
of these costs, it would be owing entirely to the neglect
and mismanagement of the Trustee, the Complainant
These defendants deny all continuation &c and
pray to be here so dismissed with their reasonable costs
in this behalf most wrongfully sustained

In obedience to the enclosed commission
issuing from the Court of Equity of Orange County
North Carolina at March Term AD 1853 for
taking the examination of Josiah Turner Jr
concerning a certain matter of controversy in
said Court pending wherein Josiah Turner [Sr] is
Plaintiff and James Dodd & wife & Thomas
Lutterloh are Defendants I have this day
caused the said Josiah Turner Jr to appear
before me at the Office of the Clerk & Master
in the Town of Hillsboro in said County of
Orange on the 12th day of September 1853-
who being duly sworn upon the Holy evangelist
of Almighty God deposed and says as follows
That is to say -
               1st Question
                            State what you know
relative to the controversy between the Plaintiff
and Defendants in this suit - and what [x-out]
passed between you and the Defendant Dodd
in September 1850 in the Town of Fayetteville
               Answer -
                   Thi[sic] Plaintiff having heard that
Dodd the Defendant had sold the boy Fred to
a Negro Trade living in the State of Louisiana
sent me to Fayetteville with a write to be
served on Johnston for the boy Fred

[page 5]
["before" x-out] and to require of Dodd to give
security that he would sell none other of
the Trust Negroes - I was at the Hotel
when Mr Winslow came in - he is mistaken
in being sent by Dodd - for neither Dodd nor any other
person knew my business in Fayetteville.  On had
I ever seen Dodd - at that time - Mr Winslow
informed me Fred had been sold - and that
Dodd had offered May Ann & child for sale -
That day or the next I saw Dodd - who stated
he had bought a House & lot with the money
received for Fred excess perhaps 100$ which he
had loaned out - I then told him that
the Plaintiff require him to give security that
he would sell none other of the negroes -
He was quite indignant at my request
swore he never would give the security
and that his counsel had advised him
that he could sell them all - and Turner
would not be hurt by it - I then
told him I would put process of law
in the hand of the Sheriff - which would
take the negroes from him - His reply
was in oaths with a threat to kill the man
who took them I left him to hunt the sheriff
into whose deputies hands I put the writ
["a" x-out] again Dodd - and one against Johnson
to be served on Johnston in case he returned
to Cumberland County

[page 6]
Mr Winslow then saw me a second time
    He offered no bond or security for Dodd as I
understood - He Winslow asked if it could not
be amicably settled - I replied that after
Dodds behavior he could settle the matter
with the Sheriff - who had the writs - while
this conversation was going on with
Mr Winslow - Dodd & the officer came into
the Hotel - Dodd made no proposition to
give security; but said - I was only trying to
get him in jail, but he had given security
to officer then showed me the bond which
Dodd had given - [x-out]I took Mr Winslows
["interference" x-out] part in the matter to be
that of a friend rather than an agent -
