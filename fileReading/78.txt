growing at my death when completed and
secured: all my House hold and Kitchen
furniture: my Waggons and gear; and
all my tools and other plantation implements

monies arising therefrom, or from such
monies I may die possessed of to pay all
my just debts; and to defray my funeral
expenses. - It is my wish to be buried
decently though not expensively.

            To remove all doubt or misonstruction
of my intentions in the foregoing Item
                                    It/

It is my will that in the event of my death
happening while a crop is growing that the
Negroes should be kept together or not
divided until the crop is finished; But
my Executors may sell such part of the stock
as they may think not essential or necessary
to enable them to complete the growing Crop.

            I give and devise to my Son Francis
the plantation on which I now reside
with all my lands adjoining to him his
Heirs and assigns forever.

            I give and devise to my son

Creek, together with the tract of land
on Bolands Creek which I bought of
Tapley Boothe, to him his Heirs and
assigns forever -- I also give and bequeath

Toney and Gift[Note 1] and my Blacksmiths tools
to him his Heirs and assigns for ever

            Whereas at the marriage of my
three Daughters Elizabeth, Nancy and
Susanna I gave to them respectively certain
Negroes towit to my daughter Elizabeth who

            And whereas some years ago being

Polly Allen daughter of my Daughter
Elizabeth who then resided in the State of
Tennessee, I loaned to her a certain Negroe
Girl known by the name of Rachel
and permitted my said Grand daughter
Polly to take home with her the said
Negroe girl to Tennessee, I therefore give
and bequeath to my said Grand Daughter
Polly, ["and her Heirs and assigns" x-out] the said Girl
Rachel with her increase to her her Heirs and assigns for ever

            I give and bequeath to my
Grand-son Christopher Allen, son of my
Daughter Elizabeth, a Negroe Girl to be

[page 4]
My executors may either furnish the
two Girls bequeathed to my said Grandsons
from the stock of Negroes I may die possessed
of or if they should prefer it may, from
the surplusage of the monies arising from the
sales of my Crops, stock & tools purchase
the said Girls and thereby keep the families
of negroes, I may die possessed of more
entire or undivided

            The residue of my Negroes, not
specifically herein before bequeathed with
their increase; together with the monies
I may die possessed of and those that
may arise from the sales of my Crop
or Crops, tools, furniture and other
articles directed to be sold in the first
Item of my Will, after satisfying my just
debts and funeral expenses, I give
and bequeath to my Sons Francis and
William their Heirs and assigns for ever
share and share alike: and should it
so happen that either, or both of my
said Sons Francis and William
should die before a division takes place
of the Negroes and money; it is my will
and desire that the legal representatives
of him or both dying as aforesaid, Shall
                                   enjoy /

enjoy and possess the share or proportion of
him so dying, share and share alike, in
the same manner & proportion and in the

            It is my Earnest desire and will
that the residuary Negroes maybe divided
by the Legatees in such a way or manner
that the families may be kept as entire
as possible.
            Lastly I nominate and appoint
my Son William and my friend Mace
Patterson Executors of this my last will
and Testament, and I earnestly entreat
them to undertake the Execution thereof
            Hereby revoking and making
void all Wills heretofore made by me
