Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume B, pages 292-293
Recorded Feb 1795

Numerous spelling variations of the testator's surname:
Dunwiddeee
Dunwiddie
Dunwiddee
Dunwiddy

The name of the "Negro garl" is clearly written "Gude".  The Will book copy and estate papers read "Jude" and once "Judie"

Estate Papers comprise 58 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Dunwoodie, Henry (1814)". The estate papers begin in 1812, perhaps when the testator's wife died.  There are 58 pages of them because of some dispute.

Searching for a black person named "Henderson" born about 1808 in the 1870 census in Orange County.  The best match was a Henderson Tinnin, born 1812 in NC living in Cedar Grove.  Unclear if this is the same person.
