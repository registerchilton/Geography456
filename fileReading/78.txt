Note: This was written on a very wide piece of paper that has been folded enough times that it is now two separate sheets.  It has been properly conserved with the appropriate reinforcement. The approximate location of the break is indicated with |||, without actually cutting words in  half.

There is also a copy included with the loose will, in the handwriting of the rounth era in which this was originally written, and marked "A Copy J Benton" near the signature. Several names are changed in the copy: "Gui" -> "Guy" and "Auston" -> "Austin"

Estate Papers comprise 28 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Patterson, John T (1783)".
