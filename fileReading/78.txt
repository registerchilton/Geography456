Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume D, pages 167-169
Recorded Feb 1806

Two sons are designated as "eldest", James and Elias, with son George listed as "youngest".  From context, the birth order may be James, Elias and George, thus, James is eldest and perhaps the intent was that Elias was "next eldest"?

Surname in will book copy seems to be Miliker, Milikin, etc.

No estate papers found.
