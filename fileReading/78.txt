Recorded Aug 1847

Will book copy renders the name Robert Reding as Robert Redding, and the slave Lany as Laney.

Note that testator lists the children of each of his wives, delineating which were children of each.  Per other sources, it appears that he married first, Nancy Clark who died about 1833, and then married Asenath Woods.

No estate papers found.
