and Mary to be directed and disposed of by her for -
her and their equal benefit and I seriously enjoin my -
three youngest daughters to remain together under the
direction of their eldest sister in the house I now occupy

[page 2]
and by their reciprocal exertions contribute to the support
of each other - if however my eldest daughter should marry
under circumstances which will not admit of her continuing
as guardian to her sisters - then it is my desire that all
my property be sold and equally divided between my -
four aforesaid daughters - otherwise to remain as heretofore
prescribed until the youngest of my daughters arrives
at the age of sixteen years at which time I wish my -
younger daughters to be exempted from the legal guar-
-dianship of their eldest sister and each of them as well
as her to receive an equal portion of such of my property
as may then remain - all of which property debts or demands
whether in possession or expectantcy as well that to which
my right may not be known or to which my claim -
may be disputed as that to which my title is clear and
indefeasible I give and bequeath to my four aforesaid
daughters and their heirs forever - on condition that the
portion of such of them as shall die unmarried intes-
-tate and under the age of sixteen shall go and belong
in equal degree to the survivors in exclusion of their -
brothers William and John whom nevertheless I tenderly
