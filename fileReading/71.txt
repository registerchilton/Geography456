Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume G, pages 381-382
Recorded Feb 1862

Estate Papers comprise 386 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Morgan, Jones (1861)".  "Dec 1861: Walnut Coffin $35.00", perhaps indicating that the testator died in Dec 1861.  The majority of these records have to do with the accounts of the guardian of the minor heirs of this testator.  There are long lists of items purchased, supplies, clothing, schooling, books, etc.

There is a  Doctors Bill for Care of Slaves due 1 Jan 1863, for the year of 1862.  Names include:
Linda, hired to Caudle
Dilly, hired to Jennings
Lucy, hired to J. Jenkins
Clarisa, not hired out.

This is a wealthy estate, and these papers include the time of almost the entire civil war, emancipation, and into the 1870's.  This transcription is focused on family history, but if a researcher is interested in the larger historical events, the effects are reflected in these estate papers, though not transcribed here.  For instance there is an account detailing the replacement of fencing destroyed as a consequence of the hostilities.  There are the accounts of the hire of negroes prior to emancipation, and there are some items dealing with Confederate money, etc.
