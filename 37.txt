Will of Gavin Alves - 17 Oct 1811

             (1)
To All To whom these Presents shall come,
I Gavin Alves, of the County of Orange
and state of North Carolina, being of sound
and disposing Mind and Memory, consid-
-ering the Uncertainty of Human Life, and
Judging it proper that every Person should
make a disposition of his Property accord-
-ing to his own Will, and not leave it to
that of others, Do hereby make, ordain
and publish This my Last Will and
Testament, in Manner and form following
viz-

In the first place, I desire that my Executors, here
inafter named, shall without delay make Col-
-lections of all debts due to me, and pay such
as I may owe; also that they shall sell,
for ready Money, or on Credit as they may deem
most expedient, all my Real Estate not
otherwise here in disposed of, and that the
Amount of such Sales and Collections shall
after paying the following Bequests & Legacies,
be by them transmitted to my Aunts, Eliza-
-beth and Jean Hogg and my Cousin Jane Burgess, as
far as the amount of the of two Thousand dollars,
to be divided among them equally and to
the Survivors or Survivor of them ---

And I hereby authorize and Empower my
Executors or the Survivor of them to Grant
Deeds or other Legal Conveyances to the
Purchasers or Purchaser of my Real Estate
or any part thereof ---

            In the next Place I will

[page 2]
                (2)
I Will and desire that my Negro Man John
and my Negro Woman Esther be emancipated
and set free as soon as possible after my
Decease, and that my Executors take the
Legal and proper steps for effecting my
Wishes in this respect -- Also that my Negro
Boy Stephen son of Esther be bound to some
good Tradesman, at the discretion of my
Executors, until he arrive at the age of
Twenty one Years, and that the necessary
Measures be then immediately taken to obtain
his emancipation--

It is further my Will and desire that the
House wherein my said Negro Man John
now lives in Hillsborough, together with
["a fourth of" x-out] an acre including said House
and the shop, shall be appropriated and
set apart for the use of said Negro Man
John for and during his natural life,
And at his Death to be disposed off
by my Executors as heretofore directed--
=======

And Whereas considering that my Brother,
Sisters and other immediate Relations and
Connections, are already sufficiently In-
-dependent in their circumstances, and
that the distribution of my small pro-
-perty among them would be an object
of little Importance to them -- I have
deemed it proper to Bequeath the greater
part of what Property I possess to my
Aunts Elizabeth & Jean Hogg and my
Cousin Jane Burgess, as heretofore men-
-tioned, Believing that it will be both
necessary and acceptable to them --
Nevertheless, In token of my sincere affection
