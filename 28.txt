Additional Comments:
Did not find a version of this will in any will book.  Perhaps not probated?

Estate papers comprise 15 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Allison, John (1822)".  William Huntington and Thomas Thompson were Administrators Pendente lite. The estate seems to have owned a slave in 1822: "1 Negro Boy hired to Thomas Clancy until the 28th day of December 1822 for $11.00"
