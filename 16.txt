by three good men and that the portion of each legatee

when the balance of my property shall be sold and the
money due me shall be collected with the money on
hand such of the legatees aforesaid who had less
left them shall receive as much money as shall make
his or her portion equal to the largest portion: for

be fairly dealt with and I hope and trust they
will be all satisfied --
