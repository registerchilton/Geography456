Additional Comments:
Will Book Volume B, pages 107-108
Recorded Nov 1790

Estate papers comprise four pages and are found in a folder labeled "Albright, John (1790)".  These contain a detailed inventory and sale.  No family history found.

Very unusual spellings, archaic wording.

The writer used B for P in several instances.  Perhaps a dialect?  The will book copy has interpreted these to more standard spellings.

Note 1: The only word differences between the original and will book version appears to say "Manster".  The will book version interpreted it as "manage".  Perhaps it was supposed to be "administer"
