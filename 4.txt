Estate Papers comprise 22 pages and are found in a folder labeled "Albright, Daniel (1843)".  Daniel A. Montgomery was appointed administrator.  Most of the papers pertain to a Daniel Albright, deceased with an Executor of John F. Garrett, and these papers don't appear to be the same estate as this will.  The will of the second Daniel Albright is found in Will Book Volume F, page 317, proved Nov 1846
